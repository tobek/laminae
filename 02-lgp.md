An answer to the question "is suffering needed to give context to happiness?" - their answer is "no". A perfect civilization that gently guides any visitor or resident towards benevolent perfection. Idealized Japan?

<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun>

this place is not simple, it is arguably more complex than any cardinal world

no one needs rescuing, but there are still challenges to be had

CGP vs LGP is: suffering and pain vs. "struggle" with only upside, no downside

- suffering vs struggle (effort) gives opportunity for hyper-optimized LGP struggle, but CGP might not hyper optimize cause C (although i guess could by evolutionary methods)
- what are other solutions to happiness without suffering?
- CGP has real pain and risk of failure, violence, gritty
- it's about positive vs. negative consequence. although "you lost the competition" which i can imagine in LGP with struggle, is kind of a negative consequence - but just to them really
- "I think the most you can plausibly say is that for humanlike architectures, memories of suffering (not necessarily true ones) are necessary to appreciate pleasures more complex than heroin."
    + response: "Anyway it seems to me that utopianly speaking the proper psychological contrast for pleasure is sobriety rather than pain."
- competition and striving is entertained to a huge degree and satisfied by all the creative stuff. people revel in their various masteries. striving over status isn't really a thing - everyone has what they need.

Some enormous oral history (perhaps song in unknown language) that everyone learns and memorizes but only elite understand what it means - laypeople are only as necessary initiated into bits of it where they learn this thing they've been doing/saying all their life actually means XYZ "The Retelling" (something like eulexia - but song). oral history in wisdom, maybe in clothing and everything.


Heaven. The ___ have taken it upon themselves to answer the question "is suffering needed to give context and shape to happiness?" and the answer is predetermined in their undying souls: "no". There is no suffering in ___---there are rules of course, but they are not stifling, and there is joy. The ___ of ___ are a resounding and convincing answer. This is a place where you could drop a demon into the middle of the realm, and the natural order and layout of things would guide him to be an enlightened angel. The academics of ___ study and pore endlessly over TODO to establish a perfect order that does not strive to insulate itself from the multiverse but that strives to create an endless bastion that can weather any change without doing anything except growing and perfecting.

Maybe a loose confederation of small cities, all within same min and max size, and if these ever fall or rise outside of these ranges they must split or consolidate. Cities A/B test themselves, with the most successful (mainly only by immigration and not births; births get re-assigned and raised collectively?) spreading, all aiming for the perfect civilization.

They are really really good at it. no issues with wireheading or "is struggle needed for happiness", the answer is obviously yes, but the struggle need not be suffering, there are hierarchies, there are successes and failures, value systems which petitioners strive to do well by and feel disappointment when they don't or others perceive that they don't, etc. but obviously this is a factor of great experimentation among cities. (or wait, is there some disagreement between LGP and CG...P about whether suffering oh wait at the otp right so either re-work this, or emphasis struggle vs. suffering).

all of this experimentation of millennia has produced amazing civilizations, but there doesn't seem to be an upper limit and they only continue to progress. some hyper-optimized cities have unbelievably intense struggle and competition, cyclic rituals of sobriety and joy

@conaw tweet: "Heaven is the feedback loop where the good keeps getting better"

Tokyo?

Does this (and/or other planes) have anything to say about whether humans are fundamentally born good or evil, or blank slate?

the goal is that anyone can be dropped in and will become a wonderful citizen, and many petitioners will claim---gently, as if humbly admitting---that this is the case. in practice of course you can go fuck it up, yet there are also many instances of various incorrigibles finding perfect niches here

headsoak note 724 about a system designed to allow for bad actors vs. is it ok if the good guys do it when it's not ok if the bad guys do it. "if a system breaks down when its members are bad actors, then it's a shitty system." the counter to that is "if a building falls down when its built with rotten beams, then it's a shitty building", which is obviously false. but of course it's a spectrum of how many bad components a system can take before it breaks down, and of course, the more the better.
