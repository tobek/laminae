summary: The Bauble is the ocean of dreams and nightmares. From vast warm shallows rippling with gardens of fancy and lilting tunes to dark crags and shadows of the quiet deep, the Inks who reside here guard drifting, delicate mortal minds against phantoms and rifts and the swells of storms and waves.

intro: |

    The Bauble is the ocean of dreams and nightmares, the chromatic fount of both sleeping dreams and waking inspiration. This REF[lamina](laminae) is most mortals' first and only living trans-REF[Ordial](ordial-plane) experience as they drift here through the REF[verges] of sleep and reverie, their bared minds taking shape as translucent shimmers among the waters. One can distinguish here those that embrace their dreams from those that fear them: the former float in the flux of their inspiration in vast warm shallows rippling with gardens of fancy and lilting tunes, and the latter wall themselves off in latticed prisons and sink through dark crags and shadows into the hopeful quiet deep---though all this can change flavor at the mercy of sudden swells of wave or weather.

    From their vantage point here the REF[petitioners] of this realm, the Inks, can see that the creativity of a mortal mind is in fact a puncture wound in the folds of reality through which not just musings but also madnesses and monsters of the Bauble can slip. And so Inks tend to the waters carefully, guarding delicately exposed mortal minds, doing their best to chase away phantoms and soften the harsh light of dreams with gentle clouds of color and fantasy. It is an imprecise task; despite the efforts of Inks the fruits of this place remain a blessing and a curse: dreams are subject to the vagaries of tides and storms, and many artists have been tormented by the wilting lack or unharnessable abundance of inspiration.

    Dreams will not prepare you for visiting the Bauble, for in person you will find that without the veil of the Ordial all the figments that loom hazily in dreams become real, that the amorphous shapes lurking in the corner of your eye take the forms of the thoughts of nearby dreaming mortals: dreams of grandeur unbidden and unfiltered, dreams of curiosity, dreams of feared things, and the hopes and memories of strangers. On her journey here the wordless Inks flocked to this visitor, tall sprites with complex markings in the place of facial features, adorned in vibrant spiral gowns of coral foliage and glass, who pleaded to whisk her away in a boat held aloft by what appeared to be a giant hollow eye, but she did not wish to stray too far from the REF[aperture](apertures) by which she had arrived. They relented, and remained to guard against rifts and phantasms, pointing out passing fancies until the time came for this visitor to depart.

    - "you: human creativity is a glorious, nigh-divine faculty / me: a human brain is a puncture wound in the fabric of reality that monsters from outside the world can use to claw their way into it / we are not the same" - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1469396883118477316 CNC, CGC, LGC as some kind of warning? NEC as like... arbiters? if it weren't for them oh boy
    - you are here somewhere - when you're awake, your version here is asleep and still providing you with stuff. what happens if you find yourself?
    - most mortals' most direct experience with the laminae
    - the mind and dreams as a pool of water, from TMI - NEC?
        - The two main objectives of meditation practice are:
            - Developing stable attention
            - Cultivating powerful mindfulness that optimizes the interaction between attention and awareness.
        - A famous analogy in Zen compares the mind to a pool of water. This is a helpful way to think about the training and goals of meditation. If the water is agitated, churned up by wind and currents, it doesn’t provide a clear reflection nor can we see to the bottom. But as the water calms, the debris that made the pool muddy begins to settle, and the water itself becomes clear. A calm pool also reflects the sky and clouds perfectly.
        - In the same way, if the mind is agitated, disturbed by the concerns of daily life, it doesn’t accurately reflect experience. Instead, we’re caught up in projections and lack perspective. The inner workings of the mind remain murky as well, full of mental debris that clutters our thinking. Developing stable attention is the key to making the water calm, settled, and pure. Mindfulness is like the sunlight that illuminates the surface, as well as the depths.
