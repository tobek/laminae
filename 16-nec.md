what's the point?

- inspiration can be unsettling and hard to control

The Bauble is the ocean of dreams and nightmares. it is colorful and twisted, full of Limns who speak in free association. strange forms rumble under the smooth deep waves, and in some places vast warm shallows are filled with gardens of fancy and lilting tunes, while in others dark crags loom with shadows, and all can change flavor with a sudden swell of wave or weather. in this lamina you can see which petitioners in their mortal lives embraced uncertainty and change and which souls feared it. the former float surrounded by the flux of their inspiration, and the latter wall themselves off in latticed prisons and sink into the hopeful quiet deep.

the fruits of this place are a blessing and a curse: the dreams come and go at the whim of the Limns, and many artists have been torn by the wilting lack or unharnessable abundance of waking dreams. dreams of grandeur, unbidden, unfiltered, dreams of curiosity, dreams of feared things. a place where the unformed shapes beneath waters in corner of the eye take the form of the thoughts of those nearby.

you can choose to sleep there forever

*need more about limns, and one more unique component*

“One awakens refreshed from every nightmare.” ― Marty Rubin

- quotes
    - "water always finds a crack" - LND or LED or NEC
    - Adam Smith: "[wonder arises] when something quite new and singular is presented… [and] memory cannot, from all its stores, cast up any image that nearly resembles this strange appearance" (NGC? NEC?)
    - "Ideally, if anything were any good, it would be indescribable." - Edward Gorey (CGC NEC)
    - 107. A feather lands on the pond and a dozen goldfish come to poke at it. We are whoever rises into our eyes to have a look. (NGC? CGC? NEC?)
- environment
	+ of course an ocean, what things lurk beneath!
		* in most places shallow and warm, in others bottomless
	+ an area where the floor is covered in a layer of large uniform spheres packed together out of sight in all directions, unknown purpose/history
    + weather patterns that affect all dreamers
- culture
	- are the limns artists?
- elements
    - you are here somewhere - when you're awake, your version here is asleep and still providing you with stuff. what happens if you find yourself?
    - most mortals' most direct experience with the laminae
    - the mind and dreams as a pool of water, from TMI - NEC?
        - The two main objectives of meditation practice are:
            - Developing stable attention
            - Cultivating powerful mindfulness that optimizes the interaction between attention and awareness.
        - A famous analogy in Zen compares the mind to a pool of water. This is a helpful way to think about the training and goals of meditation. If the water is agitated, churned up by wind and currents, it doesn’t provide a clear reflection nor can we see to the bottom. But as the water calms, the debris that made the pool muddy begins to settle, and the water itself becomes clear. A calm pool also reflects the sky and clouds perfectly.
        - In the same way, if the mind is agitated, disturbed by the concerns of daily life, it doesn’t accurately reflect experience. Instead, we’re caught up in projections and lack perspective. The inner workings of the mind remain murky as well, full of mental debris that clutters our thinking. Developing stable attention is the key to making the water calm, settled, and pure. Mindfulness is like the sunlight that illuminates the surface, as well as the depths.

- possible elements
    - they worship a god who is crazy but they love it - CGC NEP NEC
    - "new identity idea: asane (as opposed to insane). not crazy, just renouncing and revoking sanity" https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1463771414830325761 (CNC maybe, ah wait, NEC)
    - Sleep is assumed to be death, a new spirit will take your body in the morning. reincarnation somewhere in this? NEC - they pluck your spirit/it's gone in dreams, random one re-enters
    - cosmography states this place fuels the minds of all artists - that true?
    - artists - LEC is a bit, but otherwise NEC, CNC, CGC
        - Poetic Terrorism and creative madness - http://www.yorku.ca/caitlin/1900/play/poetic_terrorism.htm maybe CNC

    - transportation: they'll take you anywhere, ferriers, psychopomps ("come aboard, we're going where you're going") NEC
    - "you: human creativity is a glorious, nigh-divine faculty / me: a human brain is a puncture wound in the fabric of reality that monsters from outside the world can use to claw their way into it / we are not the same" - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1469396883118477316 CNC, CGC, LGC as some kind of warning? NEC as like... arbiters? if it weren't for them oh boy
    - a city where there is some wild price you have to pay - like having something tattooed on your body (inspired by Palimpsest book) NEC NEP
