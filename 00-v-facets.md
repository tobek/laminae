"Facets are the philosophical undercurrents that gird our actions"

absolutes are inhospitable for mortals, but they exist. whether they actually exist (the way a fire plane might exist) or are simply mental artifacts is irrelevant, they just make sense, cause many things to fall into line? natural forces yada yada.

The facets are arranged across three axes of Method, Motive, and Means. These, respectively, answer the following questions:

TODO(indic for this list, and the next? or else some other bullet)[]

- In what manner should resources and efforts be organized?
- To what ends should resources and efforts be allocated?
- Through what means should this be achieved?

The nine facets are, accordingly:

- *Method*: &nbsp;Hierarchy <span class="glyph">ꩧ</span> --- Synthesis <span class="glyph">ꧪ</span> --- Autonomy <span class="glyph">ꩢ</span>
- *Motive*: &nbsp;Empathy <span class="glyph">ဥ</span> --- Utility <span class="glyph">၇</span> --- Power <span class="glyph">ဋ</span>
- *Means*: &nbsp;Creation <span class="glyph">ꧠ</span> --- Equilibrium <span class="glyph">ဓ</span> --- Dissolution <span class="glyph">ဗ</span>

Upon reading this, several of these facets are likely to strike you as more essential than others. Readers will vary in such assessments. All readers, however, will find that regardless of personal resonance, each of these facets *exists*, and various actors align themselves with these facets with more or less rigidity.

Within the observational structure of these absolutes, personal and cultural alignments manifest all manner of relative judgments. For instance many of those driven by REF[Empathy] find those loyal to REF[Power] as something akin to evil, while the latter will disdain the former as weak and ineffective. TODO

TODO something about teleology. each can be viewed in a wholly positive light. in practice there are no absolutes, and most balance views of opposing facets. they key understanding is not that they are immutably opposite, but that one can be sacrificed in pursuit of the other.

here we describe in detail.

## Method

intro

### Hierarchy

### Synthesis

### Autonomy

## Motive

utility sees empathy as idealistic, and power as rash

Maleficium (Bad): Ill or evil will, in its mildest application, seeks the selfish advancement of an individual. In its most hateful aspect, it is vindictive and destructive.

Beneficium (Good): Pursues the ethics of kindness and goodness. It represents the self effacement of the will of the individual toward acquisition of glory and power.

Basically this: http://easydamus.com/alignment.html

Possible real-life translations from http://easydamus.com/alignmentreal.html:

    Lawful  -> Honorable (communal? no, you could be communal and chaotic)
    Neutral -> Practical
    Chaotic -> Independent (unpredictable? individualistic?)

    Good    -> Humane
    Neutral -> Realistic
    Evil    -> Determined

    Lawful Good:         Conformity/Tradition and Benevolence
    Neutral Good:        Benevolence and Universalism
    Chaotic Good:        Universalism and Self-Direction

    Lawful Neutral:      Security and Conformity/Tradition
    Neutral Neutral:     No strong preference *or* a desire for balance
    Chaotic Neutral:     Self-Direction and Stimulation

    Lawful Evil:         Power and Security
    Neutral Evil:        Achievement and Power
    Chaotic Evil:        Stimulation and Achievement, Hedonism

    Righteous (Lawful Good) - Conformity/Tradition and Benevolence
    Humane (Neutral Good) - Benevolence and Universalism
    Transcendent (Chaotic Good) - Universalism and Self-Direction
    Autonomous (Chaotic Neutral) - Self-Direction and Stimulation
    Sybaritic (Chaotic Evil) - Stimulation and Achievement (Hedonism)
    Ambitious (Neutral Evil) - Achievement and Power
    Ascendent (Lawful Evil) - Power and Security
    Orthodox (Lawful Neutral) - Security and Conformity/Tradition
    Pragmatic (Neutral Neutral)

So could be:

(adj/v or n? adj/v works better with trimurti)

- law/neutrality/chaos
    - lawful
        - Order
        - Honor/Honorable (i know we don't want cartoonish evil, but this is too good for LE)
        - Orthodoxy/Orthodox (great with good and evil, but LNC hm)
        - Systematic
    - neutral
        - Pragmatism/Pragmatic
    - chaotic
        - Chaos/Chaotic
- good/neutral/evil
    - good
        - Benevolence/Benevolent
        - Righteousness/Righteous (you could be righteous and determined)
    - neutral
        - Pragmatism/Pragmatic or Realism/Realist
    - evil
        - Determinism/Determined
        - Ambition/Ambitious (can you not be benevolent and ambitious?)
        - Malevolence/Malevolent (cartoonish?)

pragmatism too similar to realism?

~"realism = a way of viewing the world. pragmatism = the related way of acting within it"~

### Empathy

### Utility

### Power

## Means

Creative destruction is still constructive in a sense.

None of these lean towards good/evil or law/chaos - each can be harnessed in myriad ways in the service of other alignments or only in service of itself.

creation is the inhale, preservation is the pause, destruction is the exhale. some creation myth about an ur-god whose breathing supplies the powers of these planes.

creation is an imbalance that eventually spills over into prime worlds. destruction is an imbalance that can only be fueled by prime worlds. the two forces are linked via prime worlds. preservation...

It's tempting to associate Creation or Destruction with the force of Chaos. To clear this misconception, compare Lawful Creation to Lawful Destruction. In the former, creation unfolds according to precise rules, like crystals growing, in many cases building over and giving order to pre-existing material. In the latter, destruction likewise precedes along in a very particular process, whether it be that only certain types of things are destroyed, or certain facets, or matter is destroyed or torn down in a specific way.

Nor should one think that Law tends towards Creation. While it is easy to picture Lawful reditions of the Creative traits of ambition and dynamism, the Destructive traits of delusion, apathy, and dullness come chillingly easily to some manifestations of Lawfulness.

Preservation also can also be mistaken for having a bias for Law against Chaos. Once again there are counterexamples. The properly-attuned find peace and serenity in the preservation and purity of Chaos, and Chaos has its own kind of harmony and balance that must be maintained, or else order may sometimes spawn out of chaos.

destruction seeming evil but no, think also of destruction of the things that no longer serve you, letting go.

### Creation

- Activity, energy, passion, ambitiousness, agitation, change, mutation, excitation
- Self-centeredness, egoistic, individualizing, driven, moving, dynamic

### Equilibrium

- Maintenance, harmony, protection, purity (not as in "goodness" but as in "pureness of essence"), serenity, being-ness, universality, equilibrium

### Dissolution

- Finality, dissolution, subversion, nullification, loss, darkness, ignorance, inertia, apathy, indifference, anxiety, insensitivity, imbalance, impurity, delusion, negativity, dullness, waste, death

destruction takes many paths. some approach it pursuing glee in the act of destruction itself, but this is a less pure desire, as it necessitates a cycle of creation which allows them to continue destruction. the true believers do not want anything to rise in the place of the destroyed, especially not a new order that might be more to their liking. they want literal nothing.
