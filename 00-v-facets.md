"Facets are the philosophical undercurrents that gird our actions"

absolutes are inhospitable for mortals, but they exist. whether they actually exist (the way a fire plane might exist) or are simply mental artifacts is irrelevant, they just make sense, cause many things to fall into line? natural forces yada yada.

The facets are arranged across three axes of Method, Motive, and Means. These, respectively, answer the following questions:

TODO(indic for this list, and the next? or else some other bullet)[]

- In what manner should resources and efforts be organized?
- To what ends should resources and efforts be allocated?
- Through what means should this be achieved?

The nine facets are, accordingly:

- *Method*: &nbsp;REF[Hierarchy] --- REF[Synthesis] --- REF[Autonomy]
- *Motive*: &nbsp;REF[Empathy] --- REF[Utility] --- REF[Power]
- *Means*: &nbsp;REF[Creation] --- REF[Equilibrium] --- REF[Dissolution]

Upon reading this, several of these facets are likely to strike you as more essential than others. Readers will vary in such assessments. All readers, however, will find that regardless of personal resonance, each of these facets *exists*, and various actors align themselves with these facets with more or less rigidity.

Within the observational structure of these absolutes, personal and cultural alignments manifest all manner of relative judgments. For instance many of those driven by REF[Empathy] find those loyal to REF[Power] as something akin to evil, while the latter will disdain the former as weak and ineffective. TODO

TODO something about teleology. each can be viewed in a wholly positive light. in practice there are no absolutes, and most balance views of opposing facets. they key understanding is not that they are immutably opposite, but that one can be sacrificed in pursuit of the other.

value system/code of conduct according to person/community etc, axioms from whence right and wrong. "what is fair?"

here we describe in detail.

## Method

The facets of REF[Hierarchy], REF[Synthesis], and REF[Autonomy] concern matters of control and agency: how societies organize their efforts and distribute power, and how individuals fit into and are beholden to the larger whole. Adherents each lay their own claims to concepts such as integrity, discipline, and community, and accuse those whose views differ along this axis of being untrustworthy and selfish, but in fact they simply differ over how these concepts should be manifested.

### Hierarchy

In a hierarchical system there is a clear and rigid relationship between every member in the system, and every member understands their position. Well-established hierarchies tend to be extremely effective at accomplishing goals, but they require that either participants accept the rules of the system, or that those less favored by the system are unable to change their lot: hierarchies by definition contain inequalities, and often maintain these via coercion.

Many find great comfort and purpose in the clarity of hierarchy. Devotees point out the universality of hierarchies from family trees to chains of predation among animals, and find essential hierarchy in arrangements of knowledge, language, history, music, and the body. Hierarchy should not be confused with a lack of creativity; rather hierarchy determines the channels through which ideas flow, and, while there may be more experimentation in REF[Autonomy], the constraints of a systems can produce targeted and efficient creativity.

Cohesion and pride result from successful hierarchies, but these are often maintained by the threat of guilt and punishment, and a strict sense of order can result in a visceral disgust at real or perceived transgressions of that order.

REF[Hierarchy] tends towards order, deference to authority, systematic analysis, honor, conformity, tradition, inflexibility, control, judgment, structure, law, discipline, and stability.

REF[Hierarchy] judges REF[Synthesis] to be unreliable and overly complicated, but finds REF[Autonomy] to be totally untrustworthy, seeing their refusal to follow rules as unprincipled, immoral, thoughtless, mercenary, and lacking in self-respect.

REF[Hierarchy] is righteous when paired with REF[Empathy], orthodox when paired with REF[Utility], and totalitarian when paired with REF[Power].

### Synthesis

REF[Synthesis] believes that dictums are valuable and should be neither ignored nor abused. No hierarchy is perfect, for no one system can account for the range and details of individual challenges that are best understood by the individuals closest to those challenges, but nor can large and complex tasks be surmounted without structure and objective accountability. Disciples often take into account multiple and contradictory hierarchies in which responsibilities and status depend on context and rules should not be followed blindly.

REF[Synthesis] tends towards practicality, pragmatism, balance, harmony, focus, realism, and syncretism.

REF[Synthesis] regards REF[Hierarchy] as reflexively rigid and incapable of nuanced judgement, and sees REF[Autonomy] as recklessly idealistic.

REF[Synthesis] is humane and cooperative when paired with REF[Empathy], practical and diligent when paired with REF[Utility], and ambitious when paired with REF[Power].

### Autonomy

The capacity to make wholly self-directed decisions, free from coercion, is sacred to REF[Autonomy]. Adherents reject external control and believe the individual can only be whole if self-sufficient and possessed of conscience and dignity.

This paradigm is accused by REF[Hierarchy] of being disorganized and untrustworthy. The rebuttal that an autonomous society requires a higher degree of organization and trust, and that a hierarchical one must use dogma to patch over a chronic lack of trust, where codified laws make up for individuals lacking ethical compasses that would otherwise guide their actions. Likewise REF[Autonomy] does not imply a lack of accountability---rather they require it where hierarchies shield members from accountability via appeals to authority as justification actions. In practice, however, these proclamations can be idealistic, and breakdown in any of these qualities results in chaos, fragmentation, and sometimes antagonism.

REF[Autonomy] tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.

REF[Autonomy] accuses accuses REF[Synthesis] of pedantry and cowardliness, but lambasts REF[Hierarchy] for being close-minded, servile, unprincipled, and corrupt.

REF[Autonomy] is universalist when paired with REF[Empathy], maverick when paired with REF[Utility], and voracious when paired with REF[Power].

## Motive

how to determine what is an acceptable goal

~"realism = a way of viewing the world. pragmatism = the related way of acting within it"~

each see their own vision as one of integrity and honor

utility sees empathy as idealistic, and power as rash

Maleficium (Bad): Ill or evil will, in its mildest application, seeks the selfish advancement of an individual. In its most hateful aspect, it is vindictive and destructive.

Beneficium (Good): Pursues the ethics of kindness and goodness. It represents the self effacement of the will of the individual toward acquisition of glory and power.


    Good    -> Humane
    Neutral -> Realistic
    Evil    -> Determined

    Righteous (Lawful Good) - Conformity/Tradition and Benevolence
    Humane (Neutral Good) - Benevolence and Universalism
    Transcendent (Chaotic Good) - Universalism and Self-Direction
    Autonomous (Chaotic Neutral) - Self-Direction and Stimulation
    Sybaritic (Chaotic Evil) - Stimulation and Achievement (Hedonism)
    Ambitious (Neutral Evil) - Achievement and Power
    Ascendant (Lawful Evil) - Power and Security
    Orthodox (Lawful Neutral) - Security and Conformity/Tradition
    Pragmatic (Neutral Neutral)

- good/neutral/evil
    - good
        - Benevolence/Benevolent
        - Righteousness/Righteous (you could be righteous and determined)
    - neutral
        - Pragmatism/Pragmatic or Realism/Realist
    - evil
        - Determinism/Determined
        - Ambition/Ambitious (can you not be benevolent and ambitious?)
        - Malevolence/Malevolent (cartoonish?)

everyone supports "community" but how communities are defined will vary a lot

### Empathy

concerned with not offending

shame and ostracism, even occasionally subverting itself to revenge

righteousness and purity when paired with REF[Hierarchy], TODO when paired with REF[Synthesis], and TODO when paired with REF[Autonomy].

### Utility

pedantry

### Power

fear

## Means

Creative destruction is still constructive in a sense.

None of these lean towards good/evil or law/chaos - each can be harnessed in myriad ways in the service of other alignments or only in service of itself.

creation is the inhale, preservation is the pause, destruction is the exhale. some creation myth about an ur-god whose breathing supplies the powers of these planes.

creation is an imbalance that eventually spills over into prime worlds. destruction is an imbalance that can only be fueled by prime worlds. the two forces are linked via prime worlds. preservation...

It's tempting to associate Creation or Destruction with the force of Chaos. To clear this misconception, compare Lawful Creation to Lawful Destruction. In the former, creation unfolds according to precise rules, like crystals growing, in many cases building over and giving order to pre-existing material. In the latter, destruction likewise precedes along in a very particular process, whether it be that only certain types of things are destroyed, or certain facets, or matter is destroyed or torn down in a specific way.

Nor should one think that Law tends towards Creation. While it is easy to picture Lawful reditions of the Creative traits of ambition and dynamism, the Destructive traits of delusion, apathy, and dullness come chillingly easily to some manifestations of Lawfulness.

Preservation also can also be mistaken for having a bias for Law against Chaos. Once again there are counterexamples. The properly-attuned find peace and serenity in the preservation and purity of Chaos, and Chaos has its own kind of harmony and balance that must be maintained, or else order may sometimes spawn out of chaos.

destruction seeming evil but no, think also of destruction of the things that no longer serve you, letting go.

### Creation

- Activity, energy, passion, ambitiousness, agitation, change, mutation, excitation
- Self-centeredness, egoistic, individualizing, driven, moving, dynamic

### Equilibrium

- Maintenance, harmony, protection, purity (not as in "goodness" but as in "pureness of essence"), serenity, being-ness, universality, equilibrium

### Dissolution

- Finality, dissolution, subversion, nullification, loss, darkness, ignorance, inertia, apathy, indifference, anxiety, insensitivity, imbalance, impurity, delusion, negativity, dullness, waste, death

destruction takes many paths. some approach it pursuing glee in the act of destruction itself, but this is a less pure desire, as it necessitates a cycle of creation which allows them to continue destruction. the true believers do not want anything to rise in the place of the destroyed, especially not a new order that might be more to their liking. they want literal nothing.
