"Facets are the philosophical undercurrents that gird our actions"

absolutes are inhospitable for mortals, but they exist. whether they actually exist (the way a fire plane might exist) or are simply mental artifacts is irrelevant, they just make sense, cause many things to fall into line? natural forces yada yada.
-->

the facets are arranged across three axes of Method, Motive, and Means. These, respectively, answer the following questions:

TODO(indic for this list, and the next? or else some other bullet)

- In what manner should resources and efforts be organized?
- To what ends should resources and efforts be allocated?
- Through what means should this be achieved?

The nine facets are, accordingly:

<div class="copy-table facet-table">
| | | | |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| *Method* | REF[Hierarchy] | REF[Synthesis] | REF[Autonomy] |
| *Motive* | REF[Empathy] | REF[Utility] | REF[Power] |
| *Means* | REF[Creation] | REF[Equilibrium] | REF[Dissolution] |
</div>

Upon reading this, several of these facets are likely to strike you as more essential than others. Readers will vary in such assessments. All readers, however, will find that regardless of personal resonance, each of these facets *exists*, and various actors align themselves with these facets with more or less rigidity.

Within the observational structure of these absolutes, personal and cultural alignments manifest all manner of relative judgments. For instance many of those driven by REF[Empathy] find those loyal to REF[Power] as something akin to evil, while the latter will disdain the former as weak and ineffective. TODO

TODO something about teleology. each can be viewed in a wholly positive light. in practice there are no absolutes, and most balance views of opposing facets. they key understanding is not that they are immutably opposite, but that one can be sacrificed in pursuit of the other.

value system/code of conduct according to person/community etc, axioms from whence right and wrong. "what is fair?"

here we describe in detail.

## Method

The facets of REF[Hierarchy], REF[Synthesis], and REF[Autonomy] concern matters of control and agency: how societies organize their efforts and distribute power, and how individuals fit into and are beholden to the larger whole. Adherents each lay their own claims to concepts such as integrity, discipline, and community, and accuse those whose views differ along this axis of being untrustworthy and selfish, but in fact they simply differ over how these concepts should be manifested.

### Hierarchy

In a hierarchical system there is a clear and rigid relationship between every member in the system, and every member understands their position. Well-established hierarchies tend to be extremely effective at accomplishing goals, but they require that either participants accept the rules of the system, or that those less favored by the system are unable to change their lot: hierarchies by definition contain inequalities, and often maintain these via coercion.

Many find great comfort and purpose in the clarity of hierarchy. Devotees point out the universality of hierarchies from family trees to chains of predation among animals, and find essential hierarchy in arrangements of knowledge, language, history, music, and the body. Hierarchy should not be confused with a lack of creativity; rather hierarchy determines the channels through which ideas flow, and, while there may be more experimentation in REF[Autonomy], the constraints of a systems can produce targeted and efficient creativity.

Cohesion and pride result from successful hierarchies, but these are often maintained by the threat of guilt and punishment, and a strict sense of order can result in a visceral disgust at real or perceived transgressions of that order.

REF[Hierarchy] tends towards order, deference to authority, systematic analysis, honor, conformity, tradition, inflexibility, control, judgment, structure, law, discipline, and stability.

REF[Hierarchy] judges REF[Synthesis] to be unreliable and overly complicated, but finds REF[Autonomy] to be totally untrustworthy, seeing their refusal to follow rules as unprincipled, immoral, thoughtless, mercenary, and lacking in self-respect.

REF[Hierarchy] is righteous and pure when paired with REF[Empathy], orthodox when paired with REF[Utility], and totalitarian when paired with REF[Power].

### Synthesis

REF[Synthesis] believes that dictums are valuable and should be neither ignored nor abused. No hierarchy is perfect, for no one system can account for the range and details of individual challenges that are best understood by the individuals closest to those challenges, but nor can large and complex tasks be surmounted without structure and objective accountability. Disciples often take into account multiple and contradictory hierarchies in which responsibilities and status depend on context and rules should not be followed blindly.

REF[Synthesis] tends towards practicality, pragmatism, balance, harmony, focus, realism, and syncretism.

REF[Synthesis] regards REF[Hierarchy] as reflexively rigid and incapable of nuanced judgement, and sees REF[Autonomy] as recklessly idealistic.

REF[Synthesis] is humane and cooperative when paired with REF[Empathy], practical and diligent when paired with REF[Utility], and ambitious when paired with REF[Power].

### Autonomy

The capacity to make wholly self-directed decisions, free from coercion, is sacred to REF[Autonomy]. Adherents reject external control and believe the individual can only be whole if self-sufficient and possessed of conscience and dignity.

This paradigm is accused by REF[Hierarchy] of being disorganized and untrustworthy. The rebuttal that an autonomous society requires a higher degree of organization and trust, and that a hierarchical one must use dogma to patch over a chronic lack of trust, where codified laws make up for individuals lacking ethical compasses that would otherwise guide their actions. Likewise REF[Autonomy] does not imply a lack of accountability---rather they require it where hierarchies shield members from accountability via appeals to authority as justification actions. In practice, however, these proclamations can be idealistic, and breakdown in any of these qualities results in chaos, fragmentation, and sometimes antagonism.

REF[Autonomy] tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.

REF[Autonomy] accuses accuses REF[Synthesis] of pedantry and cowardliness, but lambasts REF[Hierarchy] for being close-minded, servile, unprincipled, and corrupt.

REF[Autonomy] is universalist when paired with REF[Empathy], maverick when paired with REF[Utility], and TODO(power/autonomy pair)[voracious] when paired with REF[Power].

## Motive

The facets of REF[Empathy], REF[Utility], and REF[Power] concern the methods by which we determine whether a goal is worthy, and what drives us towards those goals. These facets dictate how one relates to other beings and nature at large, and each have their own visions of integrity and their own claims to realistic views of the world.

Most individuals feel compassion and protectiveness towards their own kin, but these facets inform how individuals prioritize the well-being of those beyond their tribe---the exact extent of one considers one's own tribe being formed largely by facets along the Method axis, REF[Hierarchy] tending toward associating identity with a large group, and REF[Autonomy] identifying with familial units or no one at all. These facets also differ greatly in their responses to perceived weakness: whether to accommodate, overcome, or exploit it.

### Empathy

REF[Empathy] believes that lack of compassion is at the root of all struggles and evils---compassion for oneself and one's community, but also for all beings and the environment. Compromise is essential in this worldview, and all perspectives must be considered before embarking on a task. Acolytes are concerned with understanding and being understood, and strive to never offend or hurt others. When this inevitably happens, conflicts are resolved with conversation and compassion in the best case, but in the worst case shame and ostracism become potent reprisals.

REF[Empathy] tends towards kindness, self-effacement, benevolence, righteousness, judgment, stubbornness, idealism, altruism, universalism, equity, compromise, compassion, and tolerance.

REF[Empathy] accuses REF[Utility] of being complicit---arguing that without the primacy of empathy even well-intentioned efforts inevitably result in harmful outcomes---and of course considers the fruits of REF[Power] to be selfish to the point of evil.

REF[Empathy] is righteous and pure when paired with REF[Hierarchy], humane and cooperative when paired with REF[Synthesis], and universalist when paired with REF[Autonomy].

### Utility

REF[Utility] aims for a nuanced realism in viewing the world, and pragmatic heuristics for acting within it. It acknowledges that individuals vary widely in their goals and moral constructs, and so find that the best one can do is to assess situations in the light of all available information and act for the balanced benefit of oneself and others. Conflicts should be measured, discussed, and resolved to the mutual advantage of all parties.

REF[Utility] tends towards rationality, pragmatism, realism, balance, pedantry, judiciousness, perception, and level-headedness.

REF[Utility] finds REF[Empathy] to be naive, and REF[Power] to be rash and monomaniacal.

REF[Utility] is orthodox when paired with REF[Hierarchy], practical and diligent when paired with REF[Synthesis], and maverick when paired with REF[Autonomy].

### Power

REF[Power] believes that nature has distributed its merits unevenly, and that efforts to accommodate this fact will backfire. Progress on all levels occurs when individuals work as hard as possible to advance their and their communities' interests, and the tension that arises when those advancements come at the expense of others only pushes others to work harder, resulting in a greater overall advancement. This is a worldview that prizes competence and beauty, but sees strength and security as essential to survival, resorting to dominance and fear to manage threats.

REF[Power] tends towards ambition, achievement, glory, determination, focus, efficiency, beauty, domination, competition, selfishness, cynicism, security, success, and luxury.

REF[Power] disdains REF[Empathy] as passive, weak, and dependent on others, while finding REF[Utility] to be manipulable and inefficient.

REF[Power] is totalitarian when paired with REF[Hierarchy], ambitious when paired with REF[Synthesis], and TODO(power/autonomy pair)[voracious] when paired with REF[Autonomy].

## Means

The facets of REF[Creation], REF[Equilibrium], and REF[Dissolution] are forces that fuel reality. They are, respectively: the inhale, the pause, and the exhale---an endless cycle that every being TODO

are harnessed by all beings, in the service of other goals or facets or sometimes only in the service of itself.

Creative destruction is still constructive in a sense.


creation is the inhale, preservation is the pause, destruction is the exhale. some creation myth about an ur-god whose breathing supplies the powers of these planes.

creation is an imbalance that eventually spills over into cardinal worlds. destruction is an imbalance that can only be fueled by cardinal worlds. the two forces are linked via cardinal worlds. preservation...


### Creation

- Activity, energy, passion, ambitiousness, agitation, change, mutation, excitation, creativity
- Self-centeredness, egoistic, individualizing, driven, moving, dynamic

### Equilibrium

observation? others kinda too require

- Maintenance, harmony, protection, purity (not as in "goodness" but as in "pureness of essence"), serenity, being-ness, renewal, preservation, persistence
- stagnation

### Dissolution

destruction is scary, and powerful, but not evil in the slightest, and is perfectly necessary

think also of dissolution of the things that no longer serve you, letting go.

destruction takes many paths. some approach it pursuing glee in the act of destruction itself, but this is a less pure desire, as it necessitates a cycle of creation which allows them to continue destruction. the true believers do not want anything to rise in the place of the destroyed, especially not a new order that might be more to their liking. they want literal nothing.

- like measuring what you need
- Finality, destruction, subversion, nullification, loss, darkness, ignorance, inertia, apathy, indifference, anxiety, insensitivity, imbalance, impurity, delusion, negativity, dullness, waste, death
