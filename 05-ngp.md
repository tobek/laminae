TODO: read wiki article on restorative justice


restorative justice and problem solving, past reverb

NGP regard NGD as an unhealthy shortcut, there is no need to discard, it is beter to internalize and understand

old: Literal angels that journey nomadically around the multiverse to tip the scales and shore up goodness in peril. The angel over your shoulder, swaying everyone from peasants to emperors in the face of adversity (and in opposition to NEP)

- how do they do it?
	+ do people come to them, or do they go out into cardinal worlds? trainings?
	+ do they inspire peacemakers in dreams?
- what's the actual process? i guess read about it
	+ truth & reconciliation committees/events
	+ art therapy? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_peacebuilding
	+ "fair fighting" like a duel
- so do they get involved in advising legally? no
- all sides being disappointed is good?
- major aspect is relating to each other

restorative justice & larger social restorative practices

- victim and offender meet
- get offender to understand harm caused and give opportunity to make amends
- give victim an active role in process, avoid powerlessness
- less or no focus on retribution
- everyone affected gets to discuss how, and what should be done to repair
- "because crime hurts, justice should heal"
- can also be system-wide (truth and reconciliation)
- victim-offender meeting with very few others present vs. wider groups. both in various cases
- it's "an incomplete model in that it fails to fix the fundamental, structural inequalities that make certain people more likely to be offenders than others"
- reactive (r justice) vs. proactive (other r practices)
- collaboration, not coercion

conflict resolution

- two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self (assertiveness) and concern for others (empathy). group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways.
- styles:
	+ Avoidance: joking, changing topic, denial, withdrawing - letting others deal, wait and see
	+ Yielding: accommodating, passive, pro-social, harmonize, respect
	+ Competitive: wine or lose, zero sum, arguments, violence, insult, try to force others to see their own views
	+ Conciliation: compromise, bargaining, "fairness"
	+ Cooperation: concern for all parties, *conflict as creative opportunity*
- mechanisms for actually resolving the conflict: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution#Mechanisms and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution#Fundamental_strategies

> In many Polynesian cultures, it is believed that a person's errors (called hara or hala) caused illness. Some believe error angers the gods, others that it attracts malevolent gods, and still others believe the guilt caused by error made one sick.[citation needed] "In most cases, however, specific 'untie-error' rites could be performed to atone for such errors and thereby diminish one's accumulation of them."

> The process begins with prayer. A statement of the problem is made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not "hold fast to the fault". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's emotions are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (kala) each other, letting go. They cut off the past (Ê»oki), and together they close the event with a ceremonial feast, called pani, which often included eating limu kala or kala seaweed, symbolic of the release.
