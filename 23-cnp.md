summary: A realm for those who spent their lives saying "no", the Reverie is an endless stone plain in which geometric chasms hold solitary Eremites in rest and contemplation.

intro: |

    If REF[CNC] is a realm for those whose lives were defined by saying "yes" far more than "no", the Reverie is a resting place for those who lived the reverse.^[This visitor's travelling companion at the time related the history of a hieratic scholar from Gangara's Age of Obversion, who in a desert cliffside found two apertures, one to the Premise and one to the Reverie. After extensively exploring each, correctly ascertaining that these two laminae were afterworlds and learning of their dispositions concerning lives lived full of acceptance or rejection, he constructed an entire eschatological theory based around this dichotomy. Though this theory failed to take into account the fact that these laminae were only two among many possible afterworlds, none were wiser, and his revelation and dissemination of his discovery resulted in a total reworking of the Gangaran religion's belief system, which until then had a very different understanding of the judgment of souls after death.] An endless plain of cracked, light grey stone beneath a pale sky, its only features are the widely spread out abodes of the Eremites who rest here. Each is an extremely deep hole in the ground, with a geometric opening and smooth walls, and each contains one soul in peaceful solitude.

    Many of these chasms are blank, but others reflect their resident. One houses an Eremite referred to as the Anointed: it descends to depths beyond sight, but a narrow cylindrical plinth rises up from the center, and on it is a small grassy plateau on which a man sleeps in a patch of weak sunlight that slips incongruously out of the empty sky. Another is covered by a diamond-walled structure through which one can spy gem-encrusted depths that hold a coffin swaying from golden chains. Others hold personal libraries, intricate carvings, or small pools and fountains; others seem to hold nothing at all.

    Eremites are nearly always found asleep or motionless in contemplation, and totally unresponsive to visitors, though there are reported sightings of solitary Eremites silently traversing the Reverie's plains. A notable exception is the case of the Lovers: two partners bickering indefinitely, their fractally nested arguments echoing up the bare heptagonal fissure. The pair is famously sought out for their wisdom, but inquirers must wait days or weeks at the rim for a moment of mutual exhaustion in which they may respond to a query.^[This visitor was unimpressed with the cryptic reply she received.] A few mortals have found their way here as well, to build hermitages for themselves atop the plains or in empty chasms---these are perhaps less dedicated to their solitude than the Eremites and often keen to receive rare visitors.

what's the point?

- just a beautiful place to be alone
- platonic ideal of endless hermetitude
- perfect autonomy: each individual has literally nothing to do with every other individual

    - Reveries
- quotes
- environment
    - endless black/white tiles or a wasteland?
    - DIA: Beacon, also Chichu
- culture
- cardinal interaction
    - hermits who spend time alone wear the ordial thin along this axis

info gathering

- questions
- future research
- possible elements
    - lost & found?
    - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulness> - "the goddess who presides over Alexander Pope's The Dunciad ... the daughter Chaos and "eternal Night," and her mission is to convert all the world to stupidity ("To hatch a new Saturnian age, of Lead")" (maybe CNP, NEP, NND, LED)
        - could be some rumor or historical thing or weird intervention
    - doppelganger
    - there's a prison here?
    - everything in black/white
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? eh
    - theories relating to black holes (maybe in CNP or CEP)
    - indra's net could be here?
        - if so, indra's net works for CNP but would be kind of a rebuke of *this* incarnation of CNP, in which everyone is totally alone and there is no reflection of anything. so it's like an alternate CNP
