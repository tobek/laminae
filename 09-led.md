summary: "A boundless crevasse bisects the Increpation, atop which all the soldiers of every mortal battlefield fight amidst the fallen bodies of aeons. In the depths of the crevasse loom ornate catacombs that hold the Rues: anxious intellects weaving schemes and curses to unleash upon the rest of the multiverse, none of which have ever been observed to unfold."

intro: |

    A boundless crevasse bisects the Increpation, dozens of yards across, but it is its upper surface that divides this lamina in two. Atop the crevasse in all directions is a wasteland populated by warring soldiers from every era and world---all mortal battlefields REF[verge](verges) upon the Increpation and their troops, mostly unawares, fight amidst the fallen bodies of aeons. In the depths of the crevasse (into which a steady stream of casualties plunge) an entirely different endeavor looms: in ornate and labyrinthine catacombs gather the REF[petitioners] of the place, the Rues, anxious intellects who weave schemes and curses to unleash upon the rest of the multiverse.

    <gpt>The Rues appear to have lost their ability to communicate with one another. They can still speak, and are sometimes found muttering to themselves, but they cannot understand the speech of others. These souls exist in constant fear of being unable to communicate, and so they work alone and take great pains to avoid interacting with one another. As a result, below the warring surface the Increpation is completely silent except for the sound of wind blowing through its bridges and tunnels.</gpt>

    With visitors too the Rues will not speak, and so we have only learned of the their affairs by reviewing the extensive documentation that they keep. Their endeavors range from personal curses and plots---such as causing an individual to become an insomniac, or to be forever late to every appointment they make---to great schemes involving the restructuring of entire cultures. What they accomplish, however, is a complete mystery. Rues have never been sighted verging upon the REF[cardinal], and every plan seem to have no correlation to reality. For example, one might find documentation of an effort to pollute the bloodline of a noble family over generations in order to watch a benevolent kingdom turn slowly upon its trusting populace, replete with details of allies and turncoats, locations to infiltrate, forgeries to employ, and all manner of analyses and strategies, but all of which refer to lands, cultures, names, and histories that have not been found even in the archives of REF[LNP].

    Is the multiverse too big? Is this lamina removed from the flow of time such that plans reference ancient happenings or predict things not yet come to pass? Are their schemes expertly obfuscated such that spying outsiders never understand them? Interlaminal powers tread carefully for fear of attracting the ire of the Increpation's denizens, so many assume that the longest cons and most devastating corruptions can be traced back to this lamina, but not a whit has been verified.

Beautiful, intricate, ornate.

It's an immense civilization subdivided into self-organizing groups which tackle certain domains/styles TODO examples. Lower castes scheme smaller schemes, while barons and dukes plot the restructuring of entire cultures.

    - crevasse couple dozen feet across (need to conceptualize it - tennis court?) so daylight is limited (very, it would converge to block out all light unless plane's geometry is differnt, or it slopes outwards? maybe slopes out and never seems to increase in distance), especially if the people above you have many bridged buildings..infinitely tall and deep. maybe there's one area only where the distance varies - like an amphitheater. a city used to be there but now there is only a lone demon - LED

    - "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239 (maybe LEC, LED)
