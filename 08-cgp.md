summary: Exultant yet mindful hedonists who form a kaleidoscopic community of explorations in creation and destruction, joy and suffering, exertion and renewal. Visitors are welcomed into the fold, and it is impossible not to be overwhelmed.
intro: |

    The Apeirons of the Brink hold a vigorous rivalry with REF[____[the Concordance]](LGP) regarding pursuits of happiness and fulfillment. Where those of ____[the Concordance] aim to prove that suffering is superfluous in this quest, Apeirons are eager to demonstrate what heights of realization and beauty can be attained when struggle and failure lie on the path, and their case is presented here with terrifying prowess. To genuinely engage with this place---and it is nearly impossible not to, for in the cacophony some notes inevitably strike deep---is to undergo turns of trauma and euphoria that together result in exhilarating regeneration. As a place of constant reinvention transforming the landscape and culture as if by hallucinated natural disasters, the Brink more than any other lamina of REF[Equilibrium] is fueled by waves of self-contained creation and destruction rather than a gentle balance of stillness.

    A semicircle of breakneck glaciered mountains feeds the central river delta of the Brink with colorful effluvia draining into a rough ocean. The delta is densely scattered with waterway-wended towns and caravans of Apeirons pursuing lives of infinite variation. Apeirons are irrepressibly hard-working and have at hand endless material resources and collaborators with which to shape their hedonism and creation. In a paler incarnation of this world, such pursuits would leave jaded and burnt-out aesthetes, but these aesthetes have mastered the alternation of intensity with rest and renewal and mental healing. Boredom is absent in the face of continual reallocation of hedonic interests among the wild expressions of a community of constant exploration. All the arts of craft and performance are found here of course in spectacular manifestation, but more striking are the experiments and contests and social explorations of a value system built around delighting oneself and others.

    The result is overwhelming, and every turn will strike travellers with sights never seen or thought of before. There is no attempt to calculate the optimal circumstances for individuals; instead, manifold serendipity multiplies the chances that Apeirons and visitors will fall into felicities precisely shaped to them, while inevitably multiplying the chances of the opposite---the perfect happenstance to crack them open. But Apeirons are hardy, and learn from such experiences, and some seek out tribulation as much as they do joy.

    Anyone in the multiverse is welcome to join this society, and as a result the Brink holds more mortal residents TODO(is this true)[] than perhaps any other lamina except REF[____[the Concordance]](LGP). It is however urgently recommended that you find a guide and mentor---assistance that nearly any Apeiron, who are universally kind and attentive despite their decadence, would be overjoyed to provide to a like-minded outsider---to avoid being overwhelmed and burnt out by the miracles and burdens of this place in which those who embarrass themselves or fail to find their way are seen as being entirely responsible for their fates.
