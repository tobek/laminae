what's the point?

- wow such heights of prowess!
- vs NGP - power vs empathy
- perfection, precision

The Grasp is a strange realm that appears to be some kind of simulation, game, or test for itself, carefully laid out to its own end, and that end is self-perfection. The REF[petitioners] of this place refer to themselves as Frames and insist that they are all merely different endeavors of the single collective intelligence that is the Grasp. However they differ greatly not only in their chosen endeavors, but also in their appearances and personalities.

The Frames bask in the fractal glow of an effect that runs to the reverse of REF[NGP]'s Echo. Where the Echo presents all of the causes that lead to each present result, the Grasp shows you the myriad outcomes that may occur from each potential action you consider. The effect is referred to as the Tessellation, after the visual form it often takes.^[TODO describe it - it is not perfect prediction, but tons of outcomes and the more likely ones loom larger, and the effect is perfectly responsive to your actions, so chess jiu jitsu etc. Disorienting for visitors]

The Grasp seeks to perfect itself across myriad pursuits, and to this end is filled with all these weird specially suited chambers and environments connected via black and white tiled hallways. these pursuits include martial pursuits, athletic pursuits (swimming, running), mental pursuits (chess) and esoteric applications of dexterity and precision.

Though REF[Empathy] and REF[Power] are the most antagonistic TODO(if doing some laminal arrangement section, reference it here)[] of opposing REF[facets], the Grasp and REF[NGP], which differ along only that axis, are unusually familiar with and respectful of each other. Each appreciates the power that the other holds---to understand the past and to anticipate the future---but also fears/can't really handle it, for overlaying the two effects on top of each other produces an unbearable feedback loop: for every whiff recalled by the Echo, the Tessellation plays out all of its potential ramifications, and for every such ramification the Tessellation plays out, every factor that would go into it comes out in the Echo.

This combination does, however, exist. There are regions of both laminae that REF[verge](verges) upon each other such that the two effects exist in the same place, and those few Frames and REF[Limns](NGP) who can function in such places are the closest it gets to true oracles.


something about beating akrasia here

i guess they play chess too. and jiu jitsu

- quotes
    - "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool" NEP LEP
    - "But what is the point of soft without hard, or weight without lightness? In Japan the philosophy of the relative value of things is carried so far that in ceremonial tea-making there's a little cloth they use, which they handle as if it were the weightiest thing in the world. Light things are handled as if they're heavy, heavy things as if they're weightless - in this way one finds an almost complete control over nature instead of being dominated by it!" - Noguchi NEP
    - 6. Wind cannot blow the wind away, nor water wash away the water.
- environment
    - basically a series of game rooms? all these different settings, each incongruously opens into the next
    - all for testing
    - recurring black and white tile rooms
- culture
    - self-improvement: athletes, strength - martial art too?
- decided elements
    - oracle(s) maybe in CNP? CGC somehow? NEP?
    - One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move (NNC, LGD, CNC, maybe even CNP, LED, NEP)
    - hive mind (perfecting itself)
        - experiment to see if actual hive mind
- element candidates
    - political paradigm seasonally shifts
    - pantropy
    - a city with a price to pay
- cardinal interaction

info gathering

- questions
- future research
- possible environment
    - Underwater
    - On water
    - Floating islands
    - endless black/white tiles (George Greaves)
        - could be like all these weird architectural spaces like that and tumblr pics
    - endless ruined city
- possible elements
    - oracle:
        + there is some oracle that knows what's "best" for every action in its domain - you're free to listen to it or not. "Everyone is free to listen to The Computer or not, but you know that your decision would be less efficient for accomplishing your goals. Such rebellions are useless, however, because The Computer's prediction capabilities include whether or not you will take its advice, and it acts accordingly to make sure you get the best results anyway."
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? NEP? goes well with oracle stuff but if it finds a home elsewhere cool
    - "an indigenous Amazonian society that shifted seasonally between two entirely different forms of social organization (small, authoritarian nomadic bands during the dry months; large, consensual horticultural settlements during the rainy season)" NEP
    - doppelganger (you fight them)
    - MAYBE ACTUALLY HIVE All beings part of a single collective hive intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic (or complex) mind, or are actually different minds) - should probably be NEP or LED
    - Pantropy: modifying being to suit its environment (opposite of terraforming) - NEP?
    - a city where there is some wild price you have to pay - like having something tattooed on your body (inspired by Palimpsest book) NEC NEP
    - they worship a god who is crazy but they love it - CGC NEP NEC
    - the conception of perfection. (look up quotes?) LEP NEP
        + That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. nothing to add, nothing to take away
    - weirdly insensitive and/or literally stupid, but powerful. XXD - NEP, CGD
    - Some kind of super complex interlocking yoga that I can make IRL - NED or NEP
    - someone who has one squad each of blind, deaf, numb, untasting/unsmelling guards. (maybe the deaf ones close by, so the villain can converse privately. maybe the blind ones near all the entrances). or rather guilds, each petitioner must relinquish one sense. maybe NEP, NED, LEP
    - Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, NED, LED, NEP
        + maybe some other perception issue
        + the "three perfections" - a poet, a calligrapher, and a painter, for chinese artwork. multiple sense-missing people get together to create something
    - "Fluency before understanding, discipline before imagination" NEP
    - Maori chants? maybe NEP
        + https://eng.kiamau.tki.org.nz/Teachers-notes/Waiata-and-haka
        + http://www.waiata.maori.nz/en/about
    - strange loops
        + Synthesis facet. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP?
    - Audience independent utterance - the idealization of NEP?
    - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1458552157179887621 - grokking, you have to understand your enemy to defeat them, and when you understand them you love them. also you need to love them to hate them. NEP? NED?
    - Place where certain maneuvers can temporarily slow or stop time or physical forces in a very localized area NEP
