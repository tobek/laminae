what's the point?

-
-->

the opposite of NGP - opposite of restorative justice? training, using trauma to become stronger? revenge? pacts of power

- name
- demonym
- quotes
    - "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool" NEP LEP
    - "Fluency before understanding, discipline before imagination" NEP
    - "But what is the point of soft without hard, or weight without lightness? In Japan the philosophy of the relative value of things is carried so far that in ceremonial tea-making there's a little cloth they use, which they handle as if it were the weightiest thing in the world. Light things are handled as if they're heavy, heavy things as if they're weightless - in this way one finds an almost complete control over nature instead of being dominated by it!" - Noguchi NEP
    - 6. Wind cannot blow the wind away, nor water wash away the water.
    - 25. The knife likes to think of itself as a mirror. (LED? NEP?)

    - self-improvement: athletes, strength - martial art too?

info gathering

- questions
- future research
- possible environment
    - Underwater
    - On water
    - Floating islands
    - endless black/white tiles (George Greaves)
        - could be like all these weird architectural spaces like that and tumblr pics
- possible elements
    - oracle(s) maybe in CNP? CGC somehow? NEP?
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? NEP? eh
    - "an indigenous Amazonian society that shifted seasonally between two entirely different forms of social organization (small, authoritarian nomadic bands during the dry months; large, consensual horticultural settlements during the rainy season)" NEP
    - One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move (NNC, LGD, CNC, maybe even CNP, LED, NEP)
    - doppelganger (you fight them)
    - MAYBE ACTUALLY HIVE All beings part of a single collective hive intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic (or complex) mind, or are actually different minds) - should probably be NEC or NEP. gosh could be NGD if nothing else. LED. CGC maybs behind the scenes
    - they worship a god who is crazy but they love it - CGC NEP
    - the conception of perfection. (look up quotes?) LEP NEP
        + That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. nothing to add, nothing to take away
    - Sex - LEC, CGD, CED, NEC (dreams), NEP
    - weirdly insensitive and/or literally stupid, but powerful. XXD - NEP, CGD
    - Some kind of super complex interlocking yoga that I can make IRL - NED or NEP
    - someone who has one squad each of blind, deaf, numb, untasting/unsmelling guards. (maybe the deaf ones close by, so the villain can converse privately. maybe the blind ones near all the entrances). or rather guilds, each petitioner must relinquish one sense. maybe NEP, NED, LEP
    - Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, NED, LED, NEP
        + maybe some other perception issue
        + the "three perfections" - a poet, a calligrapher, and a painter, for chinese artwork. multiple sense-missing people get together to create something
    - "Fluency before understanding, discipline before imagination" NEP
    - Maori chants? maybe NEP
        + https://eng.kiamau.tki.org.nz/Teachers-notes/Waiata-and-haka
        + http://www.waiata.maori.nz/en/about
    - strange loops
        + Synthesis facet. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP?
    - war? a thousand-mile-wide battlefield populated by warring soldiers from every era throughout history XEX
    - Audience independent utterance - the idealization of NEP?
    - No decisions except gut ones during ceremonies. Very elaborate, no time to scheme. More authentic. They facilitate this method for mortals. Like Dune emperor emissary delivers decree, obey or disobey on the spot, only way to cut through (and assess loyalty, and instinct). the sufis "believe that deep intuition is the only real guide to knowledge". human computer. fluency before understanding (quote?). NGP if nowhere else, but could be LXX or NEP
    - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1458552157179887621 - grokking, you have to understand your enemy to defeat them, and when you understand them you love them. also you need to love them to hate them. NEP? NED?
    - Place where certain maneuvers can temporarily slow or stop time or physical forces in a very localized area NEP
