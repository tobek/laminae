intro: |

    Insisting that they are all merely different endeavors of the single collective intelligence that is the Grasp, the Frames who dwell in this place as REF[petitioners] seek to perfect themselves each according to their chosen pursuit, training for athletic, martial, and intellectual prowess in a network of chambers and environments especially suited to their continual improvement.

    Frames bask in the fractal glow of an effect that runs to the reverse of the Echo found on REF[NGP]. Where the Echo results in an observer witnessing all of the past causes that lead to each present result, the Grasp shows an observer the myriad outcomes that may occur from each potential action under consideration. The effect is referred to as the Tessellation, after the visual form it often takes.^[It is not a perfect prediction, and of course for the unprepared it is a bewildering experience, but in fact it merely advances a natural capacity. Playing a game of strategy one finds that contemplating moving a token causes one to imagine the potential outcomes to which that move might lead. The same occurs when a wrestler considers a line of attack, and then considers their partner's counterattack, and so on. The Tessellation magnifies this effect such that dozens of more distant---yet still relevant---outcomes unfurl clearly before the observer. More likely outcomes loom larger, and the effect is perfectly responsive to actions, such that as one's hand hovers over tokens on the board, slight movements cause the Tessellation to present new information.]

    Though REF[Empathy] and REF[Power] are the most antagonistic TODO(if doing some laminal arrangement section, reference it here)[] of opposing REF[facets], the Braid and the Grasp (differing only along this axis) have an unusual respect for one another. Each understands the power that the other holds---to understand the past and to anticipate the future---yet also fears it, for overlaying the two effects on top of each other produces an unbearable feedback loop: for every event recalled by the Echo, the Tessellation plays out all of its potential ramifications, and for every such ramification, its history resounds with the Echo.

    And this combination can in fact be found. There are regions of both laminae that REF[verge](verges) upon each other so that the two effects can be perceived in the same place, and at some such vertexes on the Grasp reside REF[laminal](laminals) figures known as Sequiturs. Each Sequitur appears wholly different---an elemental form of crackling violent energy, or a huge faceless statue of stone and stars---and each holds nigh-oracular wisdom, but will only speak of concerns that interest it. These concerns dictate the layout and subjects of the Grasp's chambers, whose Frames confer with Sequiturs on their perpetual quests for perfection, but they do so with hesitation and awe, for should they venture too close to these echoing, tessellating regions they might go mad, and so perhaps might all the Frames at once, sharing (as they apparently do^[The Frames' assertion that they are all simply aspects of the same being is complicated by their widely varying pursuits, appearances, and personalities. Experiments have verified that distinct Frames do appear to have a shared state of consciousness in some respects, but there is scholarly debate over whether the Frames have correctly attributed this phenomenon. Potentially the Grasp itself imbues each Frame with some common experience, or it may be that the Frames are in fact all one being in some technical sense, but that practically speaking that being holds such a vast and complex mind as to render each Frame a unique persona largely unaware of activity in other regions of its own consciousness.]) a single consciousness.

TODO(other killian eng pic, removing one of the figures?)

<!--
what's the point?

- wow such heights of prowess!
- vs NGP - power vs empathy
- perfection, precision
- interesting rooms, procedures to test and improve stuff
- such intensity and devotion that they teeter on the precipice of insanity?
-->



appears to be some kind of simulation, game, or test for itself, carefully laid out to its own end, and that end is self-perfection.

However they differ greatly not only in their chosen endeavors, but also in their appearances and personalities.

The Grasp seeks to perfect itself across myriad pursuits, and to this end is filled with all these weird specially suited chambers and environments connected via black and white tiled hallways. these pursuits include martial pursuits (jiu jitsu), athletic pursuits (swimming, running), mental pursuits (chess) and esoteric applications of dexterity and precision.

something about beating akrasia here

    - "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool" NEP
    - "But what is the point of soft without hard, or weight without lightness? In Japan the philosophy of the relative value of things is carried so far that in ceremonial tea-making there's a little cloth they use, which they handle as if it were the weightiest thing in the world. Light things are handled as if they're heavy, heavy things as if they're weightless - in this way one finds an almost complete control over nature instead of being dominated by it!" - Noguchi NEP
    - 6. Wind cannot blow the wind away, nor water wash away the water.
- environment
    - basically a series of game rooms? all these different settings, each incongruously opens into the next
    - all for testing
    - recurring black and white tile rooms
- culture
    - self-improvement: athletes, strength - martial art too?
- decided elements
    - oracle(s) maybe in CNP? CGC somehow? NEP?
    - One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move (NNC, LGD, CNC, maybe even CNP, LED, NEP)
    - hive mind (perfecting itself)
        - experiment to see if actual hive mind

    - Floating islands
    - endless black/white tiles (George Greaves)
        - could be like all these weird architectural spaces like that and tumblr pics
    - endless ruined city
- possible elements
    - oracle:
        + there is some oracle that knows what's "best" for every action in its domain - you're free to listen to it or not. "Everyone is free to listen to The Computer or not, but you know that your decision would be less efficient for accomplishing your goals. Such rebellions are useless, however, because The Computer's prediction capabilities include whether or not you will take its advice, and it acts accordingly to make sure you get the best results anyway."
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? NEP? goes well with oracle stuff but if it finds a home elsewhere cool
    - "an indigenous Amazonian society that shifted seasonally between two entirely different forms of social organization (small, authoritarian nomadic bands during the dry months; large, consensual horticultural settlements during the rainy season)" NEP
    - doppelganger (you fight them)
    - MAYBE ACTUALLY HIVE All beings part of a single collective hive intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic (or complex) mind, or are actually different minds) - should probably be NEP or LED
        - AKA collective consciousness/intelligence, mindcity, hypermind, metamind, group mind
        - "Something the whole ocean is doing"
    - Pantropy: modifying being to suit its environment (opposite of terraforming) - NEP?
    - a city where there is some wild price you have to pay - like having something tattooed on your body (inspired by Palimpsest book) NEC NEP
    - the conception of perfection. (look up quotes?) NEP
        + That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. nothing to add, nothing to take away
    - weirdly insensitive and/or literally stupid, but powerful. XXD - NEP, CGD
    - Some kind of super complex interlocking yoga that I can make IRL - NED or NEP
    - someone who has one squad each of blind, deaf, numb, untasting/unsmelling guards. (maybe the deaf ones close by, so the villain can converse privately. maybe the blind ones near all the entrances). or rather guilds, each petitioner must relinquish one sense. maybe NEP, NED, LEP
    - Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, NED, LED, NEP
        + maybe some other perception issue
        + the "three perfections" - a poet, a calligrapher, and a painter, for chinese artwork. multiple sense-missing people get together to create something
    - "Fluency before understanding, discipline before imagination" NEP
    - Maori chants? maybe NEP
        + https://eng.kiamau.tki.org.nz/Teachers-notes/Waiata-and-haka
        + http://www.waiata.maori.nz/en/about
    - strange loops
        + Synthesis facet. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP?
    - Audience independent utterance - the idealization of NEP?
    - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1458552157179887621 - grokking, you have to understand your enemy to defeat them, and when you understand them you love them. also you need to love them to hate them. NEP? NED?
    - Place where certain maneuvers can temporarily slow or stop time or physical forces in a very localized area NEP
