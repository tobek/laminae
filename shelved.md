# Nature of the planes of creation/preservation/destruction themselves

Centrally located below and above the Outlands, respectively, lie the Abysm of Destruction and the Fount of Creation - endless, churning voidsBLAH. Metaphysicists believe that a constant geyser of energy rises from the plane of pure creation, through the Spire on which Sigil rests, towards the plane of pure destruction, located far above, where it incinerated. The source and destination of this energy, from a conservation of energy standpoint, is completely unknown, as the energy destroyed does not seem to recycle back into the Fount of Creation.

Whether or not there is a plane of preservation is unknown. Some believe the Outlands themselves serve as this, or somehow the prime material plan, or the Spire. More esoteric theories posit that the city of Sigil, or even the Lady of Pain herself, serve as the "plane" of preservation - as a conduit and balance between creation and destruction, as a steadying force preserving the balance of the rest of the planes.

Like the inner planes of positive and negative energy, they are breathtakingly inhospitable, and so are almost uninhabited. Unlike the other planes, no mortals end up here as petitioners after death.

Energy beings capable of surviving (maybe the same as positive/negative energy?) maybe the planes are connected?) roam the vast churn. Those creatures:

> The only life witnessed as native to these planes are the Xag-Ya and Xeg-Yi, which appear as balls of supernaturally hot or cold plasma. They seem to be sentient, since they react to language, but do not communicate themselves. If they meet each other, they will immediately rush to meet and mutually annihilate.

All other creatures not specifically tailored to handle these realms are destroyed within seconds or minutes unless they have nigh-deity-level protections. However, pockets of survivability exist here and there, anchored by minor deities, legendary artifacts, and transplanted hallowed ground.

Perhaps some kind of time distortion but need to work out exact mechanics. Maybe in Creation, time is all mixed up and multiple threads at once. Like let's say a character dies/explodes into a flock of purple starlings in human shape with oversized head. Before that happens, the flock-person shows up, recognizable. Or keeps showing up. This is a bad sign! And in Destruction, perhaps time doesn't really work at all, but not sure how that could manifest.

## Plane of Creation

Fount of Creation?

One thousandth of the energy supplied every instant in the core of this place would be enough to supply the greatest artist with a lifetime's creative energies. Esoteric attempts to tap into this plane have nearly always ended in great misfortune - an entire city torn up and twisted through with coral reefs, cotton candy, and hundreds of thousands of chaotic oil paintings from the size of a thumbnail to the size of a castle.

To be in this plane is to be suspended in what appears, deceptively, to be a directionless nothing. This is because the forces of creation are in their purest essence and have yet to materialize into recognizable form. As soon as this substance meets *any* other kind of matter, it instantly takes form, corroding and usually destroying matter in moments. An unprotected human, for instance, will erupt in a completely unpredictable fashion - a flock of birds, a geyser of blue flame,

### TODO (magical research outpost)

Some safe outpost, ridiculously impenetrable, from which wizards funnel pure creation through atom-wide tunnels through 20-feet thick magical substance in order to test interactions with different substances under different conditions. They live regimented lives, knowing that even within that bastion, spending more than a week will cause permanent insanity and mutation. This is not a society whose members have all gone subtly mad over time - they do not allow any of their members to spend more than 24 hours in the facility, and have outfitted it with sensors to indicate local weather conditions and sometimes have to abandon it for days, weeks, or even years at a time. Mishaps do happen of course, and it's only through countless generations of study that they have established an outpost and a system that keeps them safe. Those tainted by madness or mutation are never allowed back (through much protest) and are well cared for back home.

The society is based on Tintibulus[^1], where creative or destructive forces are occasionally packaged and unleased with devastating effect upon entire polyhedra of Acheron, with brief conflagrations of color and life eventually succumbing to the ashen emptiness. The bastions are each anchored by an open conduit to a continental dodecahedron, providing a source of stability and solidity to withstand those planes to where an open conduit helps maintain the outpost. (Possible some conspiracy theory about Primus of Mechanus funding/powering it for research into forces of Creation and Destruction - though those forces are not aligned with Chaos, the Primus is wary of the cycles and struggles between them, and would be much more comfortable if they died down and Preservation prevailed.)

[^1]: Layer of Acheron. "Unlike the other layers of Acheron, four-sided, five-sided, eight-sided, nine-sided, twelve-sided, and other odd-sided solids outnumber six-sided cubes on Tintibuius. The solids are made of gray volcanic stone, each coated with a layer of ashen dust to a depth of several inches (and in some places several feet or more). The constant collisions create a ringing, bell-like roar throughout the layer at all times. Few creatures live here, petitioners or otherwise. Magicians' libraries are scattered here, and is the best place in the Multiverse for magical research" due to its order, emptiness, and isolation.

## Plane of Destruction

Abysm of Destruction? How to distinguish from plane of negative energy, which is:

> boundless, bottomless, and overwhelming drain on energy. Death, entropy, void, draining cold, disintegration.... There is no light here, no heat, and any substance left here will disintegrate -- not erode like a Doomspeaker's ideal entropy, but waste away into nothingness. This includes anything material, magical or spiritual -- visiting here puts your very soul at risk!

### TODO (magical research outpost)

Counterpart to bastion in Plane of Creation? but used much less?

## Plane of Preservation

This is secret and can/should be part of a lengthy discovery quest as part of a campaign.

There is no "Plane" of Preservation. Maybe Lady of Pain herself, or maybe it's the Lady of Pain's single, sexless parent/progenitor that resides, unknowably ancient and unmoving, on top of the infinite Spire itself.

Maybe an enormous gray sphere. It can only be reached by leaping free of Sigil and escaping its guards (however that works) or by climbing the spire itself. Obviously magical means are excluded from each approach - mechanical means such as parachutes or rock-climbing equipment and portaledges are required. Flying mounts. It's got to be harder than this!

As one approaches the Spire's peak, a thrumming sound can be heard with miles. It fills the air with a solid, mind-shattering buzz that, as one gets closer, seems to prevent all conscious thought. One's vision begins to vibrate to the point of incoherence, and the sound obscures all sound, and the buzzing fills the sense of touch and the entire body, such that it's impossible to feel where one's body ends and the rest of existence begins, obliterating proprioception, orientation, gravity, and eventually all awareness.

The sphere is the focal point for all TODO, or mediates Creation/Destruction energies.

Maybe mythical place of pilgrimage/self-immolation for NNC and NNP people. The dead bodies of such supplicants lie perfectly preserved.

Maybe descendents of an ancient god's effort to mount and control the spire, a race he created to tunnel up the spire, who failed, but who resemble haggard men and women with pure grey eyeballs, oblivious to all interaction from others, kept ageless by Preservation, endlessly going about their futile, Babel-esque task of digging and building.

# The Elemental Planes

TODO

a complex and everchanging system of elemental forces such as TODO(look up alternate elemental systems), of which arbitrary poles such as Fire, Water, Earth, and Air are often identified, but no one force can be said to be more fundamental than any of the others.

these are not the subject of the present work
