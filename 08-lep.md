summary: An endless fortress city divided into two warring factions that never dare come to blows, the Crenellation requires of its citizens absolute self-sacrifice, and with that clarity of purpose executes a vision of martial and material prowess with awesome efficiency.

intro: |

    Beside the well-explored rivalry between REF[LGP] and REF[CGP] over the ultimate approach to collective fulfillment stands the Crenellation, immortally convinced of the superiority of its own approach. Their towers and battlements soar higher than either realm's, their populace's fervor and loyalty run deeper, and the civilization executes its vision of martial and material prowess with awesome efficiency.

    The Crenellation is dense city in all directions, one with all the familiar trappings of mortal totalitarianism---harsh punishments, crushing competition, intricate bureaucracy, impenetrable caste systems---and yet everywhere Rifes---alongside no small number of mortal immigrants---strive with purpose and determination; every citizen at every moment knows exactly what is required of them. One Rife hierarch presented their philosophy in some detail to this visitor which, despite its caricatured view of opposing REF[laminae], deserves relating in full:

    > <gpt>The weak assume that beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. We, for in our wisdom we feel it with exceptional strength, know that beings don't only want comfort, safety, and well-wishes; they also want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. This is psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. It is our duty to impose intolerable burdens on our peoples. Whereas the Concordance and the Brink have said to their citizens “I offer you a good time”, we have said to ours “I offer you struggle, danger, and oblivion”, and as a result entire cultures fling themselves at our feet.</gpt> <!-- George Orwell review of Mein Kampf, 1940 -->

    In this visitor's understanding, the Crenellation drives its citizens forwards with two overarching constructs. The first is a system known as the Eulexia: a monumental oral scripture that all Rifes must memorize and repeat under myriad circumstances. The Eulexia, however, is spoken in a language that Rifes do not understand. An elite caste of hierophants guards the Eulexia's meaning, and many advancements in this society are granted by way of their revelations. It is an elegant system, Rifes say, to find for instance that the instructions and expectations of a new role are contained entirely in a segment of scripture that one has been repeating for countless years.

    The second element that holds this lamina together is the enemy. In an endless city of ramparts one wall larger than all the others follows a tortuous path that divides it in two. These two sides are said to carry the same Eulexia but to have entirely different interpretations of it, and as a result they loathe and fear one another. And so the Rifes' considerable energies go towards building defensive battlements ever higher and deeper into their own territories, as well as spying upon their opponents, stockpiling war machines, and training in limitless drills. At predetermined intervals the two sides face off in great military marches along the border and yet have never in recorded history come to blows. Despite this knowledge, the threat of attack is ever-present, and in far reaches of the Crenellation vast areas of city lie in total ruins, bolstering this fear.

    Alongside its military focus the Crenellation is in its own way extraordinarily beautiful. From fortress towers one can see the city spiral into the distance in impregnable geometric arrangements that rival REF[LNC] in magnificence if not in creativity: a city of citadels yet also a city of monumental concert halls, statues, and high-walled avenues through which wend the fearsome parades and ecstatic cults of a society seized with the iron conviction of purpose.

<!--
what's the point?

- orwell quote, ZHP wet dream, and it works
-->

aghast at this visitor crossing the gate between the two sides

"optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs.

easily the most militarily powerful of all the laminae, but since they remain in defensive mode indefinitely, it's all moot.

there was once some extraordinary incident where a trickster managed to harness their military might---maybe either by luring an enemy into hopeless attack against these guys, or by somehow managing them to, for once, sally out from their fortresses.

orwell quote, but what's the "danger and death", wouldn't they catch on eventually at possible threats never coming? or maybe orwellianish they hear about threats and attacks and incursions but none are real or they're all inside jobs, maybe even people know but they're terrified to say because they'll get disappeared if they disobey, it's an open secret. the struggle is really internal.

Milton Controversy:

> why Milton, a fervent (if unconventional) Protestant, would ultimately give the devil all the poem’s best lines? Why make Lucifer the most attractive character in Paradise Lost if you’re supposedly trying to “justify the ways of God to man?” Many in the Romantic tradition thus argued that Lucifer should be read as a revolutionary, a Promethean figure who tears at unfair strictures.
>
> [...] Fish interpreted Milton’s epic as “a poem about how its readers came to be the way they are … to provoke in its readers wayward fallen responses.” In other words, Lucifer is supposed to be intriguing, because in forcing the reader of Paradise Lost to be drawn to evil, Milton demonstrates the original sin that he believed marked everyone’s soul. That Lucifer gets the best lines isn’t incidental to his evil, but central to it.
>
> [...] these [Luciferian] characters share a rage generated from feeling that they are owed something

1984:

    The three states have been at war with each other since the 1960s. By 1984 it has become a constant, and they regularly change allegiance with each other. Each state is self-supporting so they do not war over natural resources, nor is the destruction of the opponent the primary objective; for, even when two states ally against the third, no combination is powerful enough to do so. According to Fabio Parasecoli, war is necessary to use up the oversupply constantly generated by the respective extreme forms of capitalism. Each state recognises that science is responsible for its over-production, so science must be carefully controlled lest the proles or Outer Party expect an increased standard of living. From this analysis stems the policy of permanent warfare: by focusing production on arms and materiel (rather than consumer goods) each state can keep its population impoverished and willing to sacrifice personal liberties for the greater good. The peoples of these states—subject to shortages, queues, poor infrastructure and food— "are no longer domesticated or even able to be domesticated " says Carr.

    These states all, in effect, use the same totalitarianism, and are similar monolithic regimes. Historian Mark Connelly notes that "the beliefs may differ, but their purpose is the same, to justify and maintain the unquestioned leadership of a totalitarian elite". Each uses artificially-induced hatred of its then-enemy by its citizenry to control them. Due to the sheer size of the protagonists, there are, says Connelly, no "massive invasions claiming hundreds of thousands of lives", but instead small-scale, local encounters and conflicts which are then exaggerated for the purposes of domestic propaganda.

this is sub-optimal, don't do this. but there needs to be SOMETHING to keep everyone busy. though the laws of production aren't the same on the laminae
