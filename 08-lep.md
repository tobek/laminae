In on the LGP/CGP questions? This or LEC has to be a cruel but beautiful and powerful and successful society, what ZHP wants.

Paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible maze fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize, obsessively studying, the best at it. The culture has spiraled into paranoia (too much like LND?) - or just be a citystate? Or maybe the whole place but minus the paranoia. "optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs.

tyrants

regimented armies. gauntlet and boot

easily the most militarily powerful of all the laminae, but since they remain in defensive mode indefinitely, it's all moot.

there was once some extraordinary incident where a trickster managed to harness their military might---maybe either by luring an enemy into hopeless attack against these guys, or by somehow managing them to, for once, sally out from their fortresses.

orwell quote, but what's the "danger and death", wouldn't they catch on eventually at possible threats never coming? or maybe orwellianish they hear about threats and attacks and incursions but none are real or they're all inside jobs, maybe even people know but they're terrified to say because they'll get disappeared if they disobey, it's an open secret. the struggle is really internal.

maybe it's actually not bad, if you're into it?

Milton Controversy:

> why Milton, a fervent (if unconventional) Protestant, would ultimately give the devil all the poem’s best lines? Why make Lucifer the most attractive character in Paradise Lost if you’re supposedly trying to “justify the ways of God to man?” Many in the Romantic tradition thus argued that Lucifer should be read as a revolutionary, a Promethean figure who tears at unfair strictures.
>
> [...] Fish interpreted Milton’s epic as “a poem about how its readers came to be the way they are … to provoke in its readers wayward fallen responses.” In other words, Lucifer is supposed to be intriguing, because in forcing the reader of Paradise Lost to be drawn to evil, Milton demonstrates the original sin that he believed marked everyone’s soul. That Lucifer gets the best lines isn’t incidental to his evil, but central to it.
>
> [...] these [Luciferian] characters share a rage generated from feeling that they are owed something

    - "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239 (maybe LEC, LED)

1984:

    The three states have been at war with each other since the 1960s. By 1984 it has become a constant, and they regularly change allegiance with each other. Each state is self-supporting so they do not war over natural resources, nor is the destruction of the opponent the primary objective; for, even when two states ally against the third, no combination is powerful enough to do so. According to Fabio Parasecoli, war is necessary to use up the oversupply constantly generated by the respective extreme forms of capitalism. Each state recognises that science is responsible for its over-production, so science must be carefully controlled lest the proles or Outer Party expect an increased standard of living. From this analysis stems the policy of permanent warfare: by focusing production on arms and materiel (rather than consumer goods) each state can keep its population impoverished and willing to sacrifice personal liberties for the greater good. The peoples of these states—subject to shortages, queues, poor infrastructure and food— "are no longer domesticated or even able to be domesticated " says Carr.

    These states all, in effect, use the same totalitarianism, and are similar monolithic regimes. Historian Mark Connelly notes that "the beliefs may differ, but their purpose is the same, to justify and maintain the unquestioned leadership of a totalitarian elite". Each uses artificially-induced hatred of its then-enemy by its citizenry to control them. Due to the sheer size of the protagonists, there are, says Connelly, no "massive invasions claiming hundreds of thousands of lives", but instead small-scale, local encounters and conflicts which are then exaggerated for the purposes of domestic propaganda.

this is sub-optimal, don't do this. but there needs to be SOMETHING to keep everyone busy. though the laws of production aren't the same on the laminae
