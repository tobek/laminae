In on the LGP/CGP questions? This or LEC has to be a cruel but beautiful and powerful and successful society, what ZHP wants.

Paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible maze fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize, obsessively studying, the best at it. The culture has spiraled into paranoia (too much like LND?) - or just be a citystate? Or maybe the whole place but minus the paranoia. "optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs.

tyrants

regimented armies. gauntlet and boot

easily the most militarily powerful of all the laminae, but since they remain in defensive mode indefinitely, it's all moot.

there was once some extraordinary incident where a trickster managed to harness their military might---maybe either by luring an enemy into hopeless attack against these guys, or by somehow managing them to, for once, sally out from their fortresses.

orwell quote, but what's the "danger and death", wouldn't they catch on eventually at possible threats never coming? or maybe orwellianish they hear about threats and attacks and incursions but none are real or they're all inside jobs, maybe even people know but they're terrified to say because they'll get disappeared if they disobey, it's an open secret. the struggle is really internal.

maybe it's actually not bad, if you're into it?

Milton Controversy:

> why Milton, a fervent (if unconventional) Protestant, would ultimately give the devil all the poem’s best lines? Why make Lucifer the most attractive character in Paradise Lost if you’re supposedly trying to “justify the ways of God to man?” Many in the Romantic tradition thus argued that Lucifer should be read as a revolutionary, a Promethean figure who tears at unfair strictures.
>
> [...] Fish interpreted Milton’s epic as “a poem about how its readers came to be the way they are … to provoke in its readers wayward fallen responses.” In other words, Lucifer is supposed to be intriguing, because in forcing the reader of Paradise Lost to be drawn to evil, Milton demonstrates the original sin that he believed marked everyone’s soul. That Lucifer gets the best lines isn’t incidental to his evil, but central to it.
>
> [...] these [Luciferian] characters share a rage generated from feeling that they are owed something

LEP'ers feel this?

Liberalism and Conservatism are not [there are no] philosophies, only habits, and neither is enough to guide us" - https://mobile.twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1447553891109949440 XXP? CXX? NXX. LEP?

        + That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. nothing to add, nothing to take away

    - caste systems (LND? LEC LEP) mentioned in LEC and in TOC but doesn't have to be major there
    - someone who has one squad each of blind, deaf, numb, untasting/unsmelling guards. (maybe the deaf ones close by, so the villain can converse privately. maybe the blind ones near all the entrances). or rather guilds, each petitioner must relinquish one sense. maybe NEP, NED, LEP
    - realm outside of cause-and-effect? maybe lawful or neutral somehow? LEP maybe, or else CNC or CGC. used in CNC but open to it going elsewhere

    - "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239 (maybe LEC, LED)
