Facets describe ethical, moral, and philosophical outlooks on reality from which communities create value systems of right and wrong, grounding concepts such as "fairness" and what "ought" to be. The facets are arranged across the three axes of Method, Motive, and Means that, respectively, answer the following questions:

<style>
    p + ul li {
        line-height: 1.5;
    }
</style>

<div class="lamina-table" style="padding-left: 1rem">
| |
| :-- |
|By what *method* should resources and efforts be organized?|
|In service of what *motive* should resources and efforts be marshalled?|
|Through what *means* should this be achieved?|
</div>

The nine facets are, accordingly:

<div class="copy-table facet-table">
| | | |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| *Method* | *Motive* | *Means* |
| REF[Hierarchy] | REF[Empathy] | REF[Creation] |
| REF[Synthesis] | REF[Utility] | REF[Equilibrium] |
| REF[Autonomy] | REF[Power] | REF[Dissolution] |
</div>

Upon reading this, several of these facets are likely to strike you as more essential than others. Readers will vary in such assessments. All readers, however, will find that regardless of personal resonance, each of these facets *exists*, and individuals tend to align themselves with these facets with more or less rigidity.

These absolutes can be seen as a structure with which to measure and observe phenomena, but they also scaffold personal and cultural alignments that result in all manner of relative judgments. For instance many of those driven by REF[Empathy] find those loyal to REF[Power] as being something akin to evil, while the latter will disdain the former as weak and ineffective. Differences of facet between individuals or cultures can be extremely hard to bridge, for everyone judges others by internal compasses which have been calibrated to these facets in such a way as to make it impossible to imagine a different state of nature.

Each facet can be understood in a positive or negative light, and provides its adherents with a teleology of being. In REF[cardinal] realms of course absolutes are rare, and most balance views of opposing facets. Along each axis opposites are not wholly incompatible, but you will find that one extreme can always be sacrificed in pursuit of the other.

Whether facets exist in a material sense, or are simply mental artifacts that help structure our conceptions, is is far from agreed upon. Many believe that there are raw and tangible realms, totally inhospitable to mortals, from which these forces flow like water from an underground spring. Such forces should pass through the REF[laminae], where they are shaped by the efforts of REF[petitioners], eventually reaching cardinal worlds in recognizable forms.

## <dfn def="The facets of Hierarchy ꩧ, Synthesis ꧪ, and Autonomy ꧹ concern matters of control and agency: how societies organize their efforts and distribute power, and how individuals fit into and are beholden to the larger whole.">Method</dfn>

TODO(facet glyphs should ideally be not plaintext, instead be styled etc)[]

The facets of REF[Hierarchy], REF[Synthesis], and REF[Autonomy] concern matters of control and agency: how societies organize their efforts and distribute power, and how individuals fit into and are beholden to the larger whole. Adherents each lay their own claims to concepts such as integrity, discipline, and community, and the more strident accuse those whose views differ along this axis of being untrustworthy and selfish.

### <dfn def="Hierarchy tends towards order, deference to authority, systematic analysis, honor, conformity, tradition, inflexibility, control, judgment, structure, law, discipline, and stability.">Hierarchy</dfn>

In a hierarchical system there is a clear and rigid relationship between every member in the system, and every member understands their position. Well-established hierarchies tend to be extremely effective at accomplishing goals, but they require that either participants accept the rules of the system, or that those less favored by the system are unable to change their lot: hierarchies by definition contain inequities, and often maintain these via coercion.

Many find great comfort and purpose in the clarity of hierarchy. Devotees point out the universality of hierarchies from family trees to chains of predation among animals, and find essential hierarchy in arrangements of knowledge, language, history, music, and the body. Hierarchy should not be confused with a lack of creativity; rather hierarchy determines the channels through which ideas flow, and, while there may be more experimentation in REF[Autonomy], the constraints of a system can produce targeted and efficient creativity.

Cohesion and pride result from successful hierarchies, but these are often maintained by the threat of guilt and punishment, and a strict sense of order can result in a visceral disgust at real or perceived transgressions of that order.

REF[Hierarchy] tends towards order, deference to authority, systematic analysis, honor, conformity, tradition, inflexibility, control, judgment, structure, law, discipline, and stability.

REF[Hierarchy] judges REF[Synthesis] to be unreliable and overly complicated, but finds REF[Autonomy] to be totally untrustworthy, seeing their refusal to follow rules as unprincipled, immoral, thoughtless, mercenary, and lacking in self-respect.

REF[Hierarchy] is righteous and pure when paired with REF[Empathy], orthodox when paired with REF[Utility], and totalitarian when paired with REF[Power].

### <dfn def="Synthesis tends towards practicality, pragmatism, balance, harmony, focus, realism, observation, and syncretism.">Synthesis</dfn>

REF[Synthesis] believes that established dictums are valuable and should be neither ignored nor abused. No hierarchy is perfect, for no one system can account for the range and details of individual challenges that are best understood by the individuals closest to those challenges, but nor can large and complex tasks be surmounted without structure and objective accountability. Disciples often take into account multiple and contradictory hierarchies in which responsibilities and status depend on context and rules should not be followed blindly.

REF[Synthesis] tends towards practicality, pragmatism, balance, harmony, focus, realism, observation, and syncretism.

REF[Synthesis] regards REF[Hierarchy] as reflexively rigid and incapable of nuanced judgement, and sees REF[Autonomy] as recklessly idealistic.

REF[Synthesis] is humane and cooperative when paired with REF[Empathy], practical and diligent when paired with REF[Utility], and ambitious when paired with REF[Power].

### <dfn def="Autonomy tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.">Autonomy</dfn>

The capacity to make wholly self-directed decisions, free from coercion, is sacred to REF[Autonomy]. Adherents reject external control and believe the individual can only be whole if self-sufficient and possessed of conscience and dignity.

This paradigm is accused by REF[Hierarchy] of being disorganized and untrustworthy. The rebuttal that an autonomous society requires a higher degree of organization and trust, and that a hierarchical one must use dogma to patch over a chronic lack of trust, where codified laws make up for individuals lacking ethical compasses that would otherwise guide their actions. Likewise REF[Autonomy] does not imply a lack of accountability---rather they require it where hierarchies shield members from accountability via appeals to authority to justify actions. In practice, however, these proclamations can be idealistic, and breakdown in any of these qualities results in chaos, fragmentation, and sometimes antagonism.

REF[Autonomy] tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.

REF[Autonomy] dismisses REF[Synthesis] as pedantic and cowardly, but lambasts REF[Hierarchy] for being close-minded, servile, unprincipled, and corrupt.

REF[Autonomy] is universalist when paired with REF[Empathy], maverick when paired with REF[Utility], and TODO(power/autonomy pair)[voracious] when paired with REF[Power].

## <dfn def="The facets of Empathy ဥ, Utility ၇, and Power ဋ concern the methods by which we determine whether a goal is worthy, and what drives us towards those goals.">Motive</dfn>

The facets of REF[Empathy], REF[Utility], and REF[Power] concern the methods by which we determine whether a goal is worthy, and what drives us towards those goals. These facets dictate how one relates to other beings and to nature at large, and each have their own visions of integrity and their own claims to realistic views of the world.

Most individuals feel compassion and protectiveness towards their own kin, but these facets inform how individuals prioritize the well-being of those beyond their tribe (the exact extent of that which which one considers one's own tribe being formed largely by facets along the Method axis: REF[Hierarchy] tending toward associating identity with a large group, and REF[Autonomy] identifying with familial units or no one at all). These facets also differ greatly in their responses to perceived weakness: whether to accommodate, overcome, or exploit.

### <dfn def="Empathy tends towards kindness, self-effacement, benevolence, righteousness, judgment, stubbornness, idealism, altruism, universalism, equity, compromise, compassion, and tolerance.">Empathy</dfn>

REF[Empathy] believes that lack of compassion is at the root of all struggles and evils---compassion for oneself and one's community, but also for all beings and the environment. Compromise is essential in this worldview, and all perspectives must be considered before embarking on a task. Acolytes are concerned with understanding and being understood, and strive to never offend or hurt others. When this inevitably happens, conflicts are resolved with conversation and compassion in the best case, but in the worst case shame and ostracism become potent reprisals.

REF[Empathy] tends towards kindness, self-effacement, benevolence, righteousness, judgment, stubbornness, idealism, altruism, universalism, equity, compromise, compassion, and tolerance.

REF[Empathy] accuses REF[Utility] of being complicit---arguing that without the primacy of empathy even well-intentioned efforts inevitably result in harmful outcomes---and of course considers the fruits of REF[Power] to be selfish to the point of evil.

REF[Empathy] is righteous and pure when paired with REF[Hierarchy], humane and cooperative when paired with REF[Synthesis], and universalist when paired with REF[Autonomy].

### <dfn def="Utility tends towards rationality, pragmatism, realism, balance, pedantry, judiciousness, perception, and level-headedness.">Utility</dfn>

REF[Utility] aims for a nuanced realism in viewing the world, and pragmatic heuristics for acting within it. It rejects dogma and acknowledges that individuals vary widely in their goals and moral constructs, and argues that one should assess every situation in the light of all available information and act for the balanced benefit of oneself and others. Conflicts should be measured, discussed, and resolved to the mutual advantage of all parties.

REF[Utility] tends towards rationality, pragmatism, realism, balance, pedantry, judiciousness, perception, and level-headedness.

REF[Utility] finds REF[Empathy] to be naive, and REF[Power] to be rash and monomaniacal.

REF[Utility] is orthodox when paired with REF[Hierarchy], practical and diligent when paired with REF[Synthesis], and maverick when paired with REF[Autonomy].

### <dfn def="Power tends towards ambition, achievement, glory, determination, focus, efficiency, beauty, domination, competition, selfishness, cynicism, security, success, and luxury.">Power</dfn>

REF[Power] believes that nature has distributed its merits unevenly, and that efforts to accommodate this fact will backfire. Progress on all levels occurs when individuals work as hard as possible to advance their and their communities' interests, and the tension that arises when those advancements come at the expense of others only pushes others to work harder, resulting in a greater overall advancement. This is a worldview that prizes competence and beauty, but sees strength and security as essential to survival, resorting to dominance and fear to manage threats.

REF[Power] tends towards ambition, achievement, glory, determination, focus, efficiency, beauty, domination, competition, selfishness, cynicism, security, success, and luxury.

REF[Power] disdains REF[Empathy] as passive, weak, and dependent on others, while finding REF[Utility] to be manipulable and inefficient.

REF[Power] is totalitarian when paired with REF[Hierarchy], ambitious when paired with REF[Synthesis], and TODO(power/autonomy pair)[voracious] when paired with REF[Autonomy].

## <dfn def="The facets of Creation ꧠ, Equilibrium ဓ, and Dissolution ဗ are forces that fuel reality. They are, respectively, the inhale, the pause, and the exhale: a cycle harnessed by every being in support of its goals.">Means</dfn>

TODO(put back em dash to make above sentence better and same as below sentence, when font change improves em dash)[]

The facets of REF[Creation], REF[Equilibrium], and REF[Dissolution] are forces that fuel reality. They are, respectively: the inhale, the pause, and the exhale---a cycle harnessed by every being in support of its goals. These three facets lie in a careful balance, for any disparity would over aeons result in overflow, stagnation, or annihilation. Those who believe that the same matter has been endlessly cycling from an infinite past feel this balance very deeply, but those who believe that there was once nothing which at some point gave rise to something must believe in a delicate imbalance in favor of creation in order to account for the presence of our reality.

Where other facets can be antagonistic towards each other, each seeing their own way as more truly reflecting the nature of things, the facets of Means tend to acknowledge the necessity of balance and cycles. Despite the fervor with which adherents pursue their means, the wise know that each facet would eventually stall in the absence of the others.

### <dfn def="Creation tends towards activity, energy, passion, agitation, change, mutation, excitation, creativity, egoism, instability, uncertainty, and dynamism.">Creation</dfn>

REF[Creation] is the construction of new ideas, new energy, and new matter. Combining forms in novel ways is a manner of creation, and even creative destruction is constructive for it adds shape to what remains. As the artist will tell you, creative forces can be as maddening as they are inspiring, and take tremendous effort to harness with purpose. On REF[laminae](cosmography#laminae) this facet results in an overflow of material into cardinal worlds, and it may be that all the stuff of our existence originates from these laminae of creation.

REF[Creation] tends towards activity, energy, passion, agitation, change, mutation, excitation, creativity, egoism, instability, uncertainty, and dynamism.

### <dfn def="Equilibrium tends towards maintenance, harmony, protection, pureness of essence, persistence, stagnation, indifference, serenity, observation, renewal, inertia, and preservation.">Equilibrium</dfn>

REF[Equilibrium] is the balance and cycle of creative and destructive energies. In some cases this manifests as an active vacillation between the two, and in others there is instead a careful tiptoe of balance. REF[Laminae](cosmography#laminae) reflecting this facet are often transit points that mediate alternating forces, and many also reach to cardinal worlds to adjust or support processes already in place.

REF[Equilibrium] tends towards maintenance, harmony, protection, pureness of essence, persistence, stagnation, indifference, serenity, observation, renewal, inertia, and preservation.

### <dfn def="Dissolution tends towards finality, rest, release, destruction, nullification, loss, ignorance, waste, death, and certainty.">Dissolution</dfn>

REF[Dissolution] is powerful and frightening to most mortals, and wholly essential. It takes many paths. Some pursue glee in the act of destruction itself, while others patiently shepherd---or simply observe---natural forces of dissipation taking hold. On a personal level, dissolution concerns measuring and understanding what one needs, and letting go of past burdens. On REF[laminae](cosmography#laminae) this facet holds an imbalance that can only be sustained by an influx of material from cardinal worlds, breaking down and dispersing energies that originated in distant facets of REF[Creation].

REF[Dissolution] tends towards finality, rest, release, destruction, nullification, loss, ignorance, waste, death, and certainty.
