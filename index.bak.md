- **Lawful Good**
    - ≈≈≈≈≈≈ Lawful Good Creation *LGC*
            - *?* a surprisingly exhausting, crushing place? Too much energy? Conduit should maybe be missing from this one or CEC or CED or LEC. W40k Terra?
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Lawful Good Preservation *LGP*
            - An answer to the question "is suffering needed to give context to happiness?" - their answer is "no". A perfect civilization that gently guides any visitor or resident towards benevolent perfection. Idealized Japan?
                - Archons, Valiants
                - The Concordance, The Positioning, The Arrangement
    - ###≈≈≈ Lawful Good Destruction *LGD*
            - Resting place for famous champions (martial and otherwise) who wish to engage with evil one more time, but only if the challenge is perfectly matched such that it results in the hero simultaneously succeeding and perishing. Visitors make their cases requesting help from these mythical heros, and bookkeepers assess the odds that it will be sufficiently valiant and perilous.
                - Avatars, Archons, Ardents
                - The Ardence, The Lattice, The Reticulation (having the veins or nerves disposed like the threads of a net), The Braid
- **Neutral Good**
    - ≈≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Good Creation *NGC*
            - *?* Merchants/traders? Self-improvement?
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Good Preservation *NGP*
            - Literal angels that journey nomadically around the multiverse to tip the scales and shore up goodness in peril?
                - Nomads, Benefactors, Samaritans
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Good Destruction *NGD*
            - *?* Ritualistic athletes that push themselves to transcendent disintegration? (Not "good" enough)
- **Chaotic Good**
    - ≈≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Good Creation *CGC*
            - *?* Artists? Creative chaotic be-careful-what-you-wish-for self improvement? random acts of poetic terrorism a la those goes in SCP Foundation and Hakim Bey?
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Good Preservation *CGP*
            - Rivalry with LGP, believe suffering and risk of failure is required for happiness. Burnt out minds and exultant savants, psychedelic natural disasters tearing and regenerating the landscape. Burning man?
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Good Destruction *CGD*
            - *?* Cathartic sacrificial rituals? Celebratory graveyard/memorializing?
- **Lawful Neutral**
    - #####≈ Lawful Neutral Creation *LNC*
            - Artists and engineers that freely architect all the most famous constructions in existence. Will work with anyone on any project - all things, irrespective of emotional or moral content, are opportunities for commemoration, challenge, creation, and beauty. Islands split/join to create archipelagos/continents spread across the Glass Ocean, where enormous automatons interlock and glide across the water.
                - <a href="lnc.html">Architects of The Unfolding</a>
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Lawful Neutral Preservation *LNP*
            - Collecting everything in a crystalline library hive, for cataloging and categorization according to infinitely varied sets of overlapping ontologies, none of which can be argued to be a universally useful or applicable paradigm. Also, free storage of stuff they don't have?
                - Archivists
                - The Essentialism
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Lawful Neutral Destruction *LND*
            - OCD to its most extreme. Different factions OCD about different things, and cities built around them, e.g. cleaning things to the bone/disintegration, or smoothing until nothing remains, or analysis until meaninglessness, or repetition until nonsense
                - Smoothers
- **Neutral Neutral**
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Neutral Neutral Creation *NNC*
            - Sculptors + research/exploration in order to predict how their sculptures/creations can nudge everything towards some kind of balance, keeping endless ledgers of outcomes and future adjustments needed
                - The Precision, ‎The Hew
    - ###≈≈≈ Neutral Neutral Preservation *NNP*
            - Entire multiverse laid out like endless chess set, everything recreated in 1-to-1 scale in grayscale, nothing ever moving. For every instant in time, this plane contains one complete copy reality of occupying the full space it requires. This makes it really really hard to find anything, because every physical location is represented by an infinite number of snapshots of it over time, but if you can find anything, you can study a specific moment with limitless time and attention, even the future.
                - The Cartography, The Shape, The Aspect, The Facet, The Outlook, The Substantiation, The Exhibition, The Testimony
    - ###≈≈≈ Neutral Neutral Destruction *NND*
            - Obliterating zen monks aim for ultimate nothingness residing in blank palaces. Flawless control over their attention gives them otherwordly abilities. They occasionally gather outside their realm to perform lengthy ceremonies of "erasure" causing an unepected thing (an artifact, a memory, a person, a river, a civilization) to vanish at the end of the ceremony
                - ‎Monks, Precepts
                - The Lucidity
- **Chaotic Neutral**
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Neutral Creation *CNC*
            - *?* "Mutatorium" (fractal passageways where patient caretakers guide visitors through undertakings that cause drastic transformations that rarely go as planned)? Creative madness/art? Thieves (that... duplicate stuff?)? Mutation garden lost and found? Artists?
    - #####≈ Chaotic Neutral Preservation *CNP*
            - Basically an embodiment of the second law of thermodynamics. They are the mechanism by which the multiverse ensures that entropy always increases. They organize into collectives around particular domains of entropy - rotting food, aging, combustion, political dissolution, broken furniture, romantic miscommunication, decomposing buried treasure, etc.
                - Unravelers
                - The Churn, The Irreversibility, The Inevitability
    - ###≈≈≈ Chaotic Neutral Destruction *CND*
            - Endless plain filled with extremely deep, geometric holes, each filled by one soul who remains motionless in apathy and solitude indefinitely. Holes slowly close up on their inhabitants, who don't mind. Extremely peaceful. Rarely, one will climb out and make a pilgrimage.
                - Blighted
                - The Wilt
- **Lawful Evil**
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Lawful Evil Creation *LEC*
            - Catacombs of industrious, hierarchical workers who invent convoluted evil schemes to unleash on the rest of existence. Not a single instance of a scheme being enacted has ever been observed. Are we not looking hard enough or are they obfuscating their work? Or more of this in NEC? "optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Lawful Evil Preservation *LEP*
            - Paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize
    - ≈≈≈≈≈≈ Lawful Evil Destruction *LED*
            - Elaborate weavers of personalized, creative curses
- **Neutral Evil**
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Evil Creation *NEC*
            - Nightmare-makers
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Evil Preservation *NEP*
            - Nomadic devils - opposite of NGP
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Neutral Evil Destruction *NED*
            - Torturers. They ask the opposite question to LGP - is occasional pleasure necessary for true suffering? And two rival civilizations have formed over opposite answers to this question.
- **Chaotic Evil**
    - ##≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Evil Creation *CEC*
            - Pestilence garden full of children "playing". Anything brought here, even (especially) living things, will eventually blossom and transform hideously.
                - The Ripening
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Evil Preservation *CEP*
            - Ouroboros - filled with giant ouroboros crashing through landscape eating everything and themselves. Inhabitants routinely eat themselves, but some force suffuses the place that makes everything regenerate
    - #≈≈≈≈≈ Chaotic Evil Destruction *CED*
            - Murder as art
