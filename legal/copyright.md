copyright

For example, pretty much ANY proper name from any D&D product is theirs. You technically can’t write about Drizzt or Pelor or Myth Drannor or the Nentir Vale or mention Bigby’s Crushing Hand.

"characters and likenesses"

If something appears in the SRD, it is open gaming content

First of all, that two page OGL? It has to be reproduced VERBATIM in your work if you’re using any Open Game Content. And you aren’t allowed to change it. You have to get it exactly right. See, the OGL is not, itself, Open Gaming Content. If you reproduce it, you have to include the copyright notice and everything exactly the way they say. And you can’t move one period.

EXCEPT…

If you go down to the very end of the OGL on page two of that document, under section 15. COPYRIGHT NOTICE, you’ll see TWO copyright notices. The first is the copyright notice for the OGL itself. You need that. The second is the copyright notice for the SRD5. If you use material from the SRD5, you have to include that second notice.

The OGL doesn’t let you use anything it calls “product identity.” That is, stuff that WotC specifically says is a part of D&D’s brand and not to be touched. And that’s all spelled out in the OGL too.

> The following items are designated Product Identity, as defined in Section 1(e) of the Open Game License Version 1.0a, and are subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7 of the OGL, and are not Open Content: Dungeons & Dragons, D&D, Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master, Monster Manual, d20 System, Wizards of the Coast, d20 (when used as a trademark), Forgotten Realms, Faerûn, proper names (including those used in the names of spells or items), places, Underdark, Red Wizard of Thay, the City of Union, Heroic Domains of Ysgard, EverChanging Chaos of Limbo, Windswept Depths of Pandemonium, Infinite Layers of the Abyss, Tarterian Depths of Carceri, Gray Waste of Hades, Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, Nine Hells of Baator, Infernal Battlefield of Acheron, Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia, Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, Twin Paradises of Bytopia, Blessed Fields of Elysium, Wilderness of the Beastlands, Olympian Glades of Arborea, Concordant Domain of the Outlands, Sigil, Lady of Pain, Book of Exalted Deeds, Book of Vile Darkness, beholder, gauth, carrion crawler, tanar’ri, baatezu, displacer beast, githyanki, githzerai, mind flayer, illithid, umber hulk, yuan-ti

If there’s something – for example, a specific monster – that’s found in one of the D&D rulebooks or modules, but isn’t in the SRD, you can’t include it in your own self-published content.

Let’s assume that the word TIEFLING is a trademark owned by WotC. In D&D, tieflings are a race of demonic humanoid. Tieflings are included in the SRD, so you’re free to create and publish content that includes tieflings.

If you want to create your own version of an official D&D race that’s not found in the SRD, proceed with caution. If the name that you choose for your race is similar in sound or appearance to the official version, you are likely infringing on WotC’s trademark. Likewise, if the race has a different name, but shares substantial unique characteristics with the official version, copyright may come into play.

if you only sell stuff through the DM's Guild then you can basically use anything
