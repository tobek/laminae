TODO(what's a good way to leave things hanging when done for now - "there's a bunch of papers we haven't even looked at yet" doesn't make sense. maybe some trove that was significantly faded that improved karedian skills let us revisit, we will do our best to incorporate these changes... something better)[]

## The 222nd Year L.C.

<!-- Additionally TODO()[] -->

#### The Sixteenth of the First

Introductions have been translated for the REF[LEP], REF[NEC], and REF[CGD], as well as has been the page of notes that makes up the only information we have concerning REF[LNP].

#### The Fifteenth of the First

Introductions have been translated for the following laminae: REF[NEP], REF[LGP], REF[CED], and REF[NED].

#### The Fourteenth of the First

The introduction and outline of REF[LGC] have been translated.

#### The Thirteenth of the First

The introduction of REF[LED] has been translated.

#### The Twelfth of the First

The introduction and outline of REF[NND] have been translated, as well as the entirety of REF[CGC].

Our pace of translation improves in line with your humble translator's fluency. Additionally, two understudies have completed their apprenticeships and now join the endeavor, and with each chapter fewer unfamiliar glyphs and terms remain that have not already been researched and added to our ever-growing Karedian dictionary.

#### The Ninth of the First

The introduction and outline of both REF[CNC] and REF[CNP] have been translated.

#### The Fifth of the First

Our shiftwrights have completed an adaptation of the author's diagram laying out a cartography of the twenty-seven laminae. We have placed it on the <a href="/">title page</a> of this collection.

## The 221st Year L.C.

#### The Seventeenth of the Twelfth

The introduction and outline of REF[NGD] have been translated.

#### The Third of the Twelfth

The introduction and outline of REF[LEC] have been translated. A note on one of these pages marked a quotation as being intended to preface REF[CEC].

#### The Twenty-Sixth of the Eleventh

A stray note describing "REF[verges]" has been found, translated, and inserted into the Cosmography chapter.

#### The Eighth of the Eleventh

A REF[Translator's Note](translators-note) has been added.

The introduction and outline of REF[NGP] have been translated.

#### The Twenty-Third of the Tenth

After some delay due to preparations for the Fora Incandesca and TODO(something else interesting, maybe related to me moving)[other matters], we have resumed our translation efforts.

#### The First of the Sixth

The <span class="guild-term">Order</span> formally enters the present work---at this time comprising of translations of front matter, three laminae in full, and several more in part---into our library for consideration by associates. Significant translation work remains.

#### The Twenty-Second of the First

The <span class="guild-term">Order</span> has announced our possession of this text and committed to sharing significant translation progress with the broader scholarly community on the upcoming First of the Sixth, to coincide with the commemoration of the 350th anniversary of the establishment of the <span class="guild-term">Order</span>'s charter.

## The 217th Year L.C.

#### The Sixteenth of the Ninth

The <span class="guild-term">Order</span> has gathered all extant Karedian works in our collection and from associates' collections, as well as reviewed all available records on Ordial matters. Extensive research will be required before we can rigorously begin translation work.

## The 215th Year L.C.

#### The Nineteenth of the Fourth

The source text of the present work has come into the <span class="guild-term">Order</span>'s possession.
