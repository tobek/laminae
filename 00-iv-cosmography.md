	TODO actually add the glyphs

Those of a meticulous mind may wish to start with a broad metaphysical cartography of the worlds described in this work, but the intrepid may prefer to forge ahead into a visceral experience of the laminae and only later return here to understand how the pieces fit together. That is to say, the intrepid reader should pass over these introductory passages for now.

## Overview

The nine facets and twenty-seven laminae are familiar to all thoughtful beings, though you may not know their names or the extent of their forms. Facets are the are philosophical undercurrents that gird our actions, and laminae provide essential conceptual substance to mortal minds, their residents carrying out work that sustains the nature of mortal worlds. REF[The Inevitibility](CND) ensures the physical laws of entropy, REF[TODO(artist plane)[the Bauble]](TODO) fuels the imagination of every artist, and REF[____[the Hew]](NNC) crafts the intrinsic shape of every physical object. On each lamina, manifestations of its facets are carried out to their logical extents in marvelous and terrifying ways, and each is a lens through which to understand the strategies that guide and organize existence.

Each of the twenty-seven laminae is shaped by its location at the intersection of three axes that form the nine facets. These are described in detail in the following chapter, but in brief they are^[*Translator's Note: Each of these "facets," like many Karedian words, is represented by a single glyph, and the <span class="guild-term">Order</span> has no record of these nine glyphs in any of our dictionaries or extant Karedian texts. I have done my best to choose a single translated word which approximates each glyph's range of nuances as revealed in this work, but I will leave the original glyphs present as a reminder of the multi-layered concepts behind each.*]:

- *Method*: &nbsp;Hierarchy --- Synthesis --- Autonomy
- *Motive*: &nbsp;Empathy --- Utility --- Power
- *Means*: &nbsp;Creation --- Equilibrium --- Dissolution

These are forces that vary in strength and nature in any given place or mind, and in combination form a unique and coherent philosophy. Imagine a region that varies from hot to cold, from wet to arid, from mountainous to coastal plain. Each grouping forms a climate and ecosystem, and you might expect inhabitants of the cold misty hills to present distinct in character from inhabitants of the hot arid lowlands: they each face unique challenges and develop forms and techniques with which to face them. The twenty-seven laminae are every such grouping:

- Hierarchy Empathy Creation
- Hierarchy Empathy Equilibrium
- Hierarchy Empathy Dissolution
- Hierarchy Utility Creation
- Hierarchy Utility Equilibrium
- Hierarchy Utility Dissolution
- Hierarchy Power   Creation
- Hierarchy Power   Equilibrium

## Laminae

The laminae are afterworlds: they are among the destinations that souls, untethered from material concerns, drift towards. The laminae are also however fully tangible realms---while some have outlandish properties, most provide solid ground, breathable air, and recognizable forms---and as such souls gather laminal substance upon arrival, gaining new form with which to carry out an indeterminate existence in pursuit of the shape and ideals of that particular lamina. These re-formed souls are known as petitioners.

Petitioners choose their laminae in the same manner that an object chooses whether to float or sink in water: their nature determines their direction. The notions of merit, punishment, or reward---common to many conceptions of afterworlds, the veracity of which this visitor cannot confirm---are absent in this understanding. The log may not wish to float upon the surface, but there is neither surprise nor blame in finding that it does. Most petitioners see themselves suited to their new homelands, far better suited than they were to wherever they left, and every lamina's nature lends itself to the execution of the consequences of its facets.

And so the laminae are populated, but this is just the start. Each lamina is a wholly self-contained world, with landscape and seasons, ecosystems and cultures, history and purpose. Yet each lamina is also intrinsically linked to the rest of the multiverse: as rainwater rises from the oceans and cold air blows from the east, conceptual and material forces emanate from the laminae in manifold expressions. You have surely encountered individuals possessed of total conviction in a particular logic of being: those who see all social interactions through a lens such as social status or physical dominance, or those who find are entirely driven by an essential motivation such as the desire for communal belonging, creative production, or exhaustive categorization of their environment. The farmer with the perfect knack for predicting rain, the orator with the gilded tongue, the blind girl with perfect vision, the dance troupe with inhuman coordination---in their own ways they all channel laminal currents without (and occasionally with) their knowledge.

These currents can swell into great movements. As on laminae civilizations rise and fall and transform, each carrying out the essential nature of their lamina in varying ways, great arcs of culture across mortal worlds ebb and flow, resulting in dark ages and revivals, stagnation and revolution.

## Residents

### Petitioners

Petitioners are the re-manifestation of souls that found their way to the lamina that best suited their mortal dispositions, where they attempt to perfect and reshape themselves according to the principles of the lamina. They retain to some extent an idealized character and appearance they had in life, but are varyingly altered to match the nature of their resting place: Precepts of REF[the Lucidity](NND) for instance are all similarly neutral-featured and slight, but Unravellers of REF[the Inevitability](CND) take on fantastical forms of sprites and demons.

No memories follow souls into the laminae (dashing mortal hopes of persistent consciousness after death); some claim glimpses of their former experiences, but these are impossible to judge. Their method of arrival varies from lamina to lamina. On REF[the Inevitability](CND) petitioners appear confused and alone in its grey wastes until the Procession crashes upon them, while REF[the Concordance](LGP) welcomes its citizens as they traverse the Gossamer Arch that descends from the sky into that land's great metropolis.

Except for in in REF[the Bloom](CEC), petitioners appear as adults, and all the cycles and necessities of mortal life are superfluous. Some may eat or drink or make love, but to little material effect. They are not immortal ,but generally persist for long timespans before gradually or suddenly, due to fading relevance or injury, disperse into the background substance of their lamina. In the interim, petitioners inhabit their worlds in ways as varied as mortals do, from the solitary life of a wild nomad to the structured citizenry of a military corps, depending on the nature of the plane and their role within it.

### Mortals

Mortals are those that, for the most part, live out their short lives of joy, struggle, and complexity on the cardinal worlds of the multiverse. These are sometimes referred to as "temporals" by petitioners, for their understandable preoccupation with the passage of time. There is additionally no small number of mortals who reside on the laminae, either as visitors or as native descendants of mortals who established permanent homes there. These are known as laminal mortals, in contrast to cardinal mortals that for the most part remain oblivious to the laminae. Many laminal mortals align their philosophy and purpose with that of their chosen lamina in the same way petitioners do, sometimes working alongside them, while some mortals reside on laminae for their own purposes that may be unrelated to even contrary to those of that realm.

### Laminals

There are presences on the laminae that are neither mortals nor the transformed souls of mortals, but instead seem to be native beings born from the material of the lamina itself. These are known as laminals, and nothing can be said to be common to them all. They range from the huge and silently elegant REF[wind shifters](LNC#wind-shifters) that roam the REF[the Unfolding](LNC), to the TODO(made up)[] oracular Looms that guide petitioners on REF[The Reticulum](TODO), and have varying relationships with petitioners and mortal worlds: some live among petitioners and play a role in their societies, while others merely share the realm but form their own groups or roam as flora and fauna in native ecologies.

## Navigation

Various elegant cartographies have been proposed for the twenty-seven laminae, but this visitor has found little to support them. The analytical arrangement used in this work is convenient for comprehension, but it is best to think of each lamina as coterminous with each other lamina and all of reality, but varying in presence and strength like an uneven blanket of rain and snow.

ordial plane of course separates

Unencumbered by their corporeal forms, the barrier of the Ordial Plane becomes immaterial


## apertures

a shimmer and a distortion, gut-jerking slide down a hole you couldn't see, a kind of visual folding

- general term: gate, gateway, aperture, conduit, lock?
	- no: portal, inlet
- generally rare, powerful, heavily guarded (they provide great power or great danger) or very remote
- simply the contiguous joining of space
- bidirectional. if you have physical access, you can pass through, but often physical access is blocked
- sometimes doors locked from one or both sides
- they look totally transparent - no shimmering pool or whatever
- they can be man-made or natural, and they tend to be bounded by some material, appearing naturally as cave entrances, forked tree trunks, or the mouth of a whirlpool, and appearing unnaturally within doorways and fountains and ornate portal frames.
- mostly fixed and ancient. new ones can be created intentionally with years of intense and costly ritual, or sometimes unintentionally over generations of shared purpose. naturally occurring portals
- there is a sort of surface tension that prevents the passive passage of material, such that a portal to a flaming vortex doesn't char the other end, and a gentle hand pressed against the portal's skin will feel resistance. however, any sufficiently forceful piercing of this surface tension by agent or object will pass, pulling in a small wake of atmosphere from the origin plane. this does mean that the aforementioned flaming vortex, if in possession of airborne burning shards, will fling substantial material through the gate, and so such gates are generally closed and heavily reinforced^[Some naturally occurring gates have no such protection, for instance TODO(natural gate where one plane spews stuff into the other constantly). also of course volcanoes result from portals deep below the earth connecting to molten realms]
- petitioners generally don't go through for various reasons see above

## spells, abilities, artifacts

<!--
- teleportation circle, level 5 spell, creates shimmering portal that links to a permanent one whose sigils you know on same plane. can create permanent by casting same spot every day for a year
- plane shift, level 7 spell, choose plane, or layer within plane, maximum error of 500 miles, need forked metal rod of a certain size and composition that attuned it to the desired destination plane, tuning determines location/level, complex harmonies, some planes you can't choose layer. caster and up to 8 willing creatures holding hand in circle. can specify in general terms like "palace of dispater in 2nd level of 9 hells". can go to teleportation circle on other plane if you know sigils
- teleport, level 7 spell, teleports you and 8 willing to anywhere on same plane, depending on familiarity, teleportation circle presence, or you having an object from there, it makes it more accurate, but doesn't always work.
- gate, level 9 spell, 5-20ft diameter portal to exact spot on any plane, but deities etc. can deny this from working
- wish, level 9, could do it. but in old versions it uses XP, in new versions drains and damages you for days and 33% chance you can never cast wish again
- amulet of the planes - successful INT check you cast plane shift, failure you go to random spot on that plane or a random plane
- planeswalkers can focus for a minute and travel between planes
- "token of recall" takes you to a particular place on particular plane

## Soblei

Soblei is at once one of the most important and one of the most cursed places in the multiverse. The first thing you will hear about Soblei is that it is full of portals to the nearest and farthest reaches of reality---that is of course what makes it important. But it is a wretched place. It appears to be a wild metropolis the spectacular destruction of which was averted moments too late and then frozen in a suspended apocalypse. A blinding white light suffuses the sky, flattening everything in muted shades of gray and casting sharp, jet black shadows downwards. Geysers of rubble hang in the air and light blasts through the fissures that cleave every structure. There is a constant, howling, frigid wind, though only visitors seem to suffer it; all the matter of the city---torn awnings and splintered wagons and shards of glass---are unyielding, unaffected, even when the winds rise to hurricane force.

By all accounts and investigations Soblei exists outside of every other plane and prime world in its own dimensional cavity. It has a particular topology: though the light always strikes from above, the land curves slightly upwards underfoot, and it is said that a long enough journey may bring you back to where you started, if one can work around the massive edifices blocking many paths. There is no trace of the organic life that must have once been here. There are no bones or bodies (except those of occasional recent arrivals succumbed to exposure, whose remains lie in undecaying stasis) or animals or even food to be found, but other artifacts of city life are plentiful. Inside most buildings is an immovable maelstrom of their contents: kitchenware, clothes, books, merchandise, and tools clutter the air of pitch dark interiors in which the wind whips even more furiously.

Portals are everywhere: in city square fountains, in cellars and back rooms, palace halls and libraries. TODO navigating through rubble, clambering and squeeze, many seem inaccessible though someone may know a route.

No living creature wishes to spend time here. The wind can kill through cold or a rubble-wards bludgeoning gust, and outdoors the light can blind while indoors the wind intensifies, the noise driving one mad. But those that tread widely always pass through here, for nearly every plane is connected to Soblei, and the shortest path from one place to another usually passes through it. This visitor knows the city far, far, better than she would like to.

Despite the potential power of such a connected place, no one has conquered its hazards^[There of course have been innumerable attempts. TODO(attempts to conquer Soblei's hazards).], and it continues to function as a welcome point of friction in interplanar affairs. Though guides and strategies abound, there is no comfortable or remotely safe way to shepherd a sightseeing aristocrat or an invading army through this place. At the same time it is not so impossibly hazardous as a place like TODO(extremely inhospitable plane) such that elaborate expedition planning is required to survive at all: an individual with warm clothing, a helmet, steady balance, and directions could, with some luck, make the journey between two nearby portals. It is also an unshakably neutral place, with no possibility of building fortifications, laying traps, or setting up preparations of any kind that won't be swept away in a moment, and so over the ages Soblei has been party to a significant number of duels and high-stakes or clandestine engagements.

- guides with eye protection and special clothing
	+ some use aerodynamic plate armor, but this makes maneuverability through rubble, especially inside, quote difficult
    + maps have been made, but their usage and updates must be committed to memory so as not to get torn up by wind. Several approaches have been tried here. Stone tablets are more resilient than parchment but are hard to maneuver through the gale and if one loses control it is likely to cause injury or to be smashed against some surface. Etchings on animal hide are sufficiently resilient, but must be small or incorporated into clothing, as holding up a sheet of any size catches the wind uncontrollably. It is a difficult realm to map anyway, the notion of streets having been laid to waste. The primary things to map are landmarks, though it is hard to recognize them through a glaring squint. Up close there is an incredible diversity of building styles and materials, but struggling through the streets everything appears the same^[This visitor has over time crafted something of a personal map, using a web of small beads connected by fine chain links. Each bead is carved on one side to represent a landmark and on the other side with the Karedian glyphs denoting the destination of nearby portals, if any. These carvings can be understood by touch. The beads are chained to each other in a way that matches the orientation and proximity between landmarks, notched to indicate direction. For instance, when facing the central lizard head on a particular fountain, behind you is a library with a portal to ____[LNP], to your the left is TODO(more etc etc, unusual and destroyed landmarks, pattern on tiles, inside stuff), but that is quite some ways---four chain links as opposed to the usual one. At the time of writing this web has roughly forty beads, though in a mnemonic fashion this is a scaffold upon which this visitor's cartographic knowledge has grown somewhat larger.].
- outposts - clustered around portals?
- wind is so loud that verbal communication is impossible, and strong enough to tear up any attempt at written communication - only gestures are possible
- absolutely no stories remain of Soblei before its destruction. It is presumed to have been a resplendent and powerful metropolis at the crux of the multiverse, and various myths are associated with it but none reliable
