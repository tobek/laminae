Those of a mind more meticulous than this visitor may wish to begin with a broad metaphysical cartography of the worlds described in this work, but the intrepid may prefer to forge ahead into a visceral experience of the laminae and only later return here to understand how the pieces fit together. That is to say, the intrepid reader should pass over these introductory passages for now.

ordial plane

Outside the ring of outer planes lies these ones, and creation lies in a ring below the outer planes, and destruction lies above. For example, past the plane of Mechanus lies the plane of TODO, that of Lawful Neutral Preservation, and above and below it its destructive and creative partners.

Maybe you can reach with some special way of traversing the Hinterlands (http://www.rilmani.org/timaresh/Hinterlands)

Like other planes, there are a mix of residents:

- The majority are *petitioners* - souls of dead mortals who in life matched the alignment of the plane and now reside there indefinitely, attempting to perfect and reshape themselves according to the principles of the plane. If killed in their home plane, their energy disperses to join the plane. If killed elsewhere, their energy disperses into nothingness. Petitioners tend to look like they did in life, though often are influenced by their new residence, sometimes drastically. They no longer have memories of their mortal lives, except for rare glimpses, but their personalities and mannerisms remain. Most mortals end up on the Outer Planes after death, but those sufficiently attuned to Creation, Preservation, or Destruction will find themselves here. Petitioners inhabit their new homes in ways as varied as mortals do, ranging from solitary existences to rigid hierarchical civilizations, depending on the nature of the plane and their role within it.
	- notes, may be redundant, but supercede above:
		+ they work on appropriate projects, seek union/perfection with the alignment of plane
		+ may look like what they used to, at the age and form they most preferred in their life, sometimes somewhat idealized, and with same personalities and mannerisms and maybe interests, but often re-formed to suit
		+ no memories, maybe flashes
		+ eventually fade and merge with plane, if killed that happens
		+ with exceptions, extremely hesitant to leave their plane, both emotionally and because they are weaker and can be killed and soul lost

- Some inhabitants are *outsiders* - beings formed at least partially of the essence of these planes^[Of course, from the perspective of their home plane they would be better termed *insiders*, but we mortals have arrived at the term *outsiders* as a result of our rare collective experiences with these metaphysical lifeforms visiting us on the material planes.]. @TODO/term ("outsider" is not great here since they'll basically only be referenced in their plane... more like immortal metaphysical spirits, come up with a name. see "native outsiders" in LGD - maybe call them planars) These are not normal races like humans and elves TODO(are we doing that)[], but are other creatures usually more alien or monstrous in form. They are often unique to their plane and reflect its nature physically and spiritually. Unless killed by exotic means, outsiders who are slain tend to re-form on their home plane. They are often more powerful and influential than petitioners. Some may live among petitioners and play a role in planar society, while some may just happen to share the realm but form their own groupings or roam as flora and fauna in native ecologies.
- Lastly, and usually in the minority in these realms, are *mortals*. These are regular living beings who one way or another ended up visiting or even finding a home on that plane. Planes are often not very hospitable to mortals, but some make their way regardless. Mortals who are from the Prime Material Planes (the "regular" worlds) are known as *primes*, while *planars* are mortals born on the plane. Mortals residing on the planes may be peasants or workers or may be unfathomably powerful or anything in between, and some live on the plane to aid the plane and align themselves in the way petitioners do, while some are there for their own purposes that may be unrelated to or contrary to the plane.
- Of course, other beings make their way around the multiverse too: the undead, elementals, animated constructs, petitioners and outsiders from other realms, deities, etc., any of whom may be visitors or residents of these planes for a number of reasons.

As an afterlife, it's not punishments - assignments. Dead mortals go to the plane that most represents their ideals and approach in life, and once there, they (aim to) perfect it. everybody wins!

Residents of these realms/planes are not

Unlike Outer Planes, no deities rule? Minor deities? What are inner planes like regarding this? Some inner force instead of deities providse everything.

Centrally located below and above the Outlands, respectively, lie the Abysm of Destruction and the Fount of Creation - endless, churning voidsBLAH. Metaphysicists believe that a constant geyser of energy rises from the plane of pure creation, through the Spire on which Sigil rests, towards the plane of pure destruction, located far above, where it incinerated. The source and destination of this energy, from a conservation of energy standpoint, is completely unknown, as the energy destroyed does not seem to recycle back into the Fount of Creation.

Whether or not there is a plane of preservation is unknown. Some believe the Outlands themselves serve as this, or somehow the prime material plan, or the Spire. More esoteric theories posit that the city of Sigil, or even the Lady of Pain herself, serve as the "plane" of preservation - as a conduit and balance between creation and destruction, as a steadying force preserving the balance of the rest of the planes.

Does time pass normally in the outer outer planes? Or does it v

# Transport

TODO

## apertures

a shimmer and a distortion, gut-jerking slide down a hole you couldn't see, a kind of visual folding

- general term: gate, gateway, aperture, conduit, lock?
	- no: portal, inlet
- generally rare, powerful, heavily guarded (they provide great power or great danger) or very remote
- simply the contiguous joining of space
- bidirectional. if you have physical access, you can pass through, but often physical access is blocked
- sometimes doors locked from one or both sides
- they look totally transparent - no shimmering pool or whatever
- they can be man-made or natural, and they tend to be bounded by some material, appearing naturally as cave entrances, forked tree trunks, or the mouth of a whirlpool, and appearing unnaturally within doorways and fountains and ornate portal frames.
- mostly fixed and ancient. new ones can be created intentionally with years of intense and costly ritual, or sometimes unintentionally over generations of shared purpose. naturally occurring portals
- there is a sort of surface tension that prevents the passive passage of material, such that a portal to a flaming vortex doesn't char the other end, and a gentle hand pressed against the portal's skin will feel resistance. however, any sufficiently forceful piercing of this surface tension by agent or object will pass, pulling in a small wake of atmosphere from the origin plane. this does mean that the aforementioned flaming vortex, if in possession of airborne burning shards, will fling substantial material through the gate, and so such gates are generally closed and heavily reinforced^[Some naturally occurring gates have no such protection, for instance TODO(natural gate where one plane spews stuff into the other constantly). also of course volcanoes result from portals deep below the earth connecting to molten realms]
- petitioners generally don't go through for various reasons see above

## spells, abilities, artifacts

<!--
- teleportation circle, level 5 spell, creates shimmering portal that links to a permanent one whose sigils you know on same plane. can create permanent by casting same spot every day for a year
- plane shift, level 7 spell, choose plane, or layer within plane, maximum error of 500 miles, need forked metal rod of a certain size and composition that attuned it to the desired destination plane, tuning determines location/level, complex harmonies, some planes you can't choose layer. caster and up to 8 willing creatures holding hand in circle. can specify in general terms like "palace of dispater in 2nd level of 9 hells". can go to teleportation circle on other plane if you know sigils
- teleport, level 7 spell, teleports you and 8 willing to anywhere on same plane, depending on familiarity, teleportation circle presence, or you having an object from there, it makes it more accurate, but doesn't always work.
- gate, level 9 spell, 5-20ft diameter portal to exact spot on any plane, but deities etc. can deny this from working
- wish, level 9, could do it. but in old versions it uses XP, in new versions drains and damages you for days and 33% chance you can never cast wish again
- amulet of the planes - successful INT check you cast plane shift, failure you go to random spot on that plane or a random plane
- planeswalkers can focus for a minute and travel between planes
- "token of recall" takes you to a particular place on particular plane

# Other Realms

## The Elemental Planes

TODO

a complex and everchanging system of elemental forces such as TODO(look up alternate elemental systems), of which arbitrary poles such as Fire, Water, Earth, and Air are often identified, but no one force can be said to be more fundamental than any of the others.

these are not the subject of the present work

## TODO(name of sigil replacement)[Soblei]

Soblei is at once one of the most important and one of the most cursed places in the multiverse. The first thing you will hear about Soblei is that it is full of portals to the nearest and farthest reaches of reality---that is of course what makes it important. But it is a wretched place. It appears to be a wild metropolis the spectacular destruction of which was averted moments too late and then frozen in a suspended apocalypse. A blinding white light suffuses the sky, flattening everything in muted shades of gray and casting sharp, jet black shadows downwards. Geysers of rubble hang in the air and light blasts through the fissures that cleave every structure. There is a constant, howling, frigid wind, though only visitors seem to suffer it; all the matter of the city---torn awnings and splintered wagons and shards of glass---are unyielding, unaffected, even when the winds rise to hurricane force.

By all accounts and investigations Soblei exists outside of every other plane and prime world in its own dimensional cavity. It has a particular topology: though the light always strikes from above, the land curves slightly upwards underfoot, and it is said that a long enough journey may bring you back to where you started, if one can work around the massive edifices blocking many paths. There is no trace of the organic life that must have once been here. There are no bones or bodies (except those of occasional recent arrivals succumbed to exposure, whose remains lie in undecaying stasis) or animals or even food to be found, but other artifacts of city life are plentiful. Inside most buildings is an immovable maelstrom of their contents: kitchenware, clothes, books, merchandise, and tools clutter the air of pitch dark interiors in which the wind whips even more furiously.

Portals are everywhere: in city square fountains, in cellars and back rooms, palace halls and libraries. TODO navigating through rubble, clambering and squeeze, many seem inaccessible though someone may know a route.

No living creature wishes to spend time here. The wind can kill through cold or a rubble-wards bludgeoning gust, and outdoors the light can blind while indoors the wind intensifies, the noise driving one mad. But those that tread widely always pass through here, for nearly every plane is connected to Soblei, and the shortest path from one place to another usually passes through it. This visitor knows the city far, far, better than she would like to.

Despite the potential power of such a connected place, no one has conquered its hazards^[There of course have been innumerable attempts. TODO(attempts to conquer Soblei's hazards).], and it continues to function as a welcome point of friction in interplanar affairs. Though guides and strategies abound, there is no comfortable or remotely safe way to shepherd a sightseeing aristocrat or an invading army through this place. At the same time it is not so impossibly hazardous as a place like TODO(extremely inhospitable plane) such that elaborate expedition planning is required to survive at all: an individual with warm clothing, a helmet, steady balance, and directions could, with some luck, make the journey between two nearby portals. It is also an unshakably neutral place, with no possibility of building fortifications, laying traps, or setting up preparations of any kind that won't be swept away in a moment, and so over the ages Soblei has been party to a significant number of duels and high-stakes or clandestine engagements.

- guides with eye protection and special clothing
	+ some use aerodynamic plate armor, but this makes maneuverability through rubble, especially inside, quote difficult
    + maps have been made, but their usage and updates must be committed to memory so as not to get torn up by wind. Several approaches have been tried here. Stone tablets are more resilient than parchment but are hard to maneuver through the gale and if one loses control it is likely to cause injury or to be smashed against some surface. Etchings on animal hide are sufficiently resilient, but must be small or incorporated into clothing, as holding up a sheet of any size catches the wind uncontrollably. It is a difficult realm to map anyway, the notion of streets having been laid to waste. The primary things to map are landmarks, though it is hard to recognize them through a glaring squint. Up close there is an incredible diversity of building styles and materials, but struggling through the streets everything appears the same^[This visitor has over time crafted something of a personal map, using a web of small beads connected by fine chain links. Each bead is carved on one side to represent a landmark and on the other side with the Karedian glyphs denoting the destination of nearby portals, if any. These carvings can be understood by touch. The beads are chained to each other in a way that matches the orientation and proximity between landmarks, notched to indicate direction. For instance, when facing the central lizard head on a particular fountain, behind you is a library with a portal to ____[LNP], to your the left is TODO(more etc etc, unusual and destroyed landmarks, pattern on tiles, inside stuff), but that is quite some ways---four chain links as opposed to the usual one. At the time of writing this web has roughly forty beads, though in a mnemonic fashion this is a scaffold upon which this visitor's cartographic knowledge has grown somewhat larger.].
- outposts - clustered around portals?
- wind is so loud that verbal communication is impossible, and strong enough to tear up any attempt at written communication - only gestures are possible
- absolutely no stories remain of Soblei before its destruction. It is presumed to have been a resplendent and powerful metropolis at the crux of the multiverse, and various myths are associated with it but none reliable
