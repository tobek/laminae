# mechanics

the true destruction and creation planes are directly above and below outlands and are incredibly inhospitable. like with outlands there are borderlands.

### destruction

at the border lands things chunk and cave off, a series of cataclysms and nothingness. look into negative energy plane and void. it's similar but different in that things don't just fade, they explode, separate into pieces.

every X time period (day at the borders, hour partly in, minute further in, round at some pole) the following:

CON save or d20 damage (PC rolls?) (maybe d4 determines # of d20s to roll). this damage can't be recovered until leaving the plane

Keep track of total health lost this way, and once it equals half your max health, every future fail also roll:

- something of yours is destroyed spectacularly. roll. could be body part (even like hair) or object you're carrying
- a memory irrevocably lost
- you lose all respect/love/etc for someone in your vicinity
- lethargy - act as if fatigued or overburdened
-

for each destruction roll CON save to undo on rest (only applies to what affects your body/self - item damage or destruction is permanent). if success, effect is gone. if fail, effect sticks around until some kind of major healing.

##### hazards

- piece of landscape is destroyed. rolls: blinks out of existence, slowly disintegrates, explodes, etc.
- random elemental force (roll) attempts to destroy the vicinity - e.g. storm, tsunami, conflagration, etc.
- local vacuum - can't breath, maybe vacuum damage.
- removal of a sense - sound, vision, touch, taste, smell, balance, other senses. lasts variable length of time.

### creation

CON save. if failed, gain d20 (PC rolls?) (again maybe d4 d20s) that increases maximum too. once your max health is 50% higher than your original max, every future fail, also roll:

- skin changes color (roll for color)
- growth (extra leg, arm, one or two wings, one or two horns, tail, claws, feathers, extra head, scales, eye, crazy teeth, look through codex seraphinianus)
- elemental aura (damages others. 50% damages yourself too or not)
- crazy ideas/insight (what mechanic?)
- something comes out of you (food, item, creature, etc. 50% happens once or continuously).

some of these confer advantages and disadvantages, like increased AC for scales, reduced DEX for extra leg, etc.

next time you rest after leaving plane, you take damage equal to amount you gained and lose the max. for each creation, make a CON save. if succeeded, it goes away. if fail, it's permanent until some suitably powerful healing ability.

for any creation you wish to keep, you may give yourself a disadvantage on the CON save.

over time you can learn to control or benefit from it.

critical fail means permanent no matter what along with some negative aspect. critical success means it goes away but you have some permanent positive result (can cast some spell at will, have +1 to a characteristic, etc.)

##### hazards

X chance of rolling for following:

- sudden blinding light
- elemental intrusion/outgrowth, splashes in all directions throwing hurting etc. two options for each, flip a coin. result is permanent e.g. ongoing bonfire, ice sculpture, mountain, etc.
- deafening noise (like music or chorus or anything else less identifiable)
- something (roll: PC, NPC, creature, item, anything) duplicates or triplicates. each copy may be the same, worsened in some way or improved in some way
- chunk of prime material plane (roll: bedroom, castle, island, bar, boulder, nomadic caravan, etc) shows up wholesale. roll for method of entry: bursts through ground, careens in from sky, or...
