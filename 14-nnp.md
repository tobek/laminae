This is possibly the most uncanny of realms, for it contains copies of the entire multiverse, including itself, shorn of the concept of time and encumbered by implacable hazards. Somewhere within this realm every separate instant of the entire multiverse is replicated at full scale, animate and inanimate laid out in complete detail with all the lifelessness of a chess set. Should you chance a visit must, you must take extraordinary precautions to even survive.

You may find here the scene of your own birth, any fraction of an instant of it, and from that moment explore outwards through your world, encountering it as it was frozen at that point in time. Or you may find the scene of your death (as this visitor was incomprehensibly lucky enough to witness) or perhaps the lair of your enemy, the workshop of a future inventor, a key scene in your past or future with infinite leisure to explore and learn. But, infinitely more likely, your visits to this lamina will land you in only the most random and irrelevant of slices of space and time.

Although the overworked and over-inspired dream of the ability to stop time, and occasional wizards attain this control, the passage of time is so deeply rooted in the experiences of sentient things that a world without time feels broken; the cold silence of things that should be breathing is unnerving. And despite a superficial appearance of normality, it is deathly dangerous here. Light, sound, warmth, and even breath do not follow their normal patterns, and many visitors lose their grasp and remain forever as frozen additions to the display.

## Environment

The ____[Cartography] is unfathomably vast, and navigating it is both very straightforward and quite impossible. From within a given replica of a moment in time and space, known as a tableau, you may explore the geography of the world as normal: everything is laid out at one-to-one scale. But there is no obvious way to remain in the same location and move forwards or backwards in time, nor does there seem to be any way to move to a drastically different location (say, a different lamina) while remaining at the same moment in time. Portals from outside the lamina connect to a range of tableau of course, and methods are known to attempt travel to a desired tableau, with terrible risk and unpredictability. Most journeys here lead to tableau that unrelated or useless except for curiosity or perhaps meditation, and most often of all you will arrive in what appears to be an infinite primordial darkness.

It is not a pleasant place to loiter. The first thing you will notice is that this realm is devastatingly cold. Unprotected, you will succumb in minutes from a cold shock worse than being plunged into an icy lake: rapid breathing, panic, muscle incapacitation, and failure of the heart. Touching an object with bare skin will result immediate and severe frostbite. Encumbrous physical protection will work for a time, but magical warmth is typically needed.

Beyond the cold there are several other unusual properties here. There is no sound possible at all except for the faintest of mufflings audible with your ear pressed against something. Even shouting in another's ear only generates a drawn-out murmur. Scents, too, are faint, and frozen in the air: you may just barely smell the smoke of a newly lit fire when next to the fire itself, but it will not travel far, unless the fire was lit sufficiently long ago that the smell would have already traveled that distance.

More unsettlingly, the movement of light itself slows to a crawl. When holding your arm out, there is about a second's delay before your eyes detect any movements your hand makes, but of course the parts of your arm closer to you appear to move more quickly, so the result of sweeping your arm to the side is a distorted gradual motion from your shoulder outwards. Of course, since nothing in the environment moves this only mildly disorienting when alone, but in the presence of other visitors, this effect combines with the absence of sound to sculpt a claustrophobic experience where you can never trust your senses.

The full effect of this deserves to be laid out in detail. Light appears to travel at about 1 yard every second, which the average person can easily outrun. Imagine someone stands 10 yards away from you. It will take them no more than 5 seconds to reach you, at which point you can still see them as they were standing 10 yards away 10 seconds ago. The first sign that you would have that they reached you would be them suddenly appearing directly in front of you, after which their motion towards you is slowly revealed in a reverse blur. Eyeball-to-eyeball you see the them, 1 second after that you can see them when they were still 1 yard away from you running towards you, then 2 seconds after that you can see them as they were 2 seconds prior, until eventually the image of them standing 10 yards ago fades. And were you to attempt to reach out to someone by you, they may no longer be in the location you reach for.

The sense of touch is unusual too, and even more so the inertia of all matter. Everything in the environment of any substance at all is firm as diamond, completely immovable and invulnerable. You cannot kick so much as a pebble, and water is solid as metal. Lighter objects yield just barely: you can, with enough force to bend metal, nudge a feather that was floating in the air, and wherever you managed to move it to, it would continue to remain suspended there. If you succeeded in moving the feather to inside your pocket, it would be very hard to walk away, as it would tear the pocket loose from your clothing and remain where it was in space.

Though clear air and gaseous forms don't resist movement, clear air is rare. A dusty room must be waded through as if through a sea of floating needlepoints. That dust, as well as water droplets from fog or even pollen, all accumulate on clothing and hair and in the lungs and will increasingly bog you down. This can be fatal!

A peculiar inversion results here. Water, quicksand, acid, and lava alike are gracious, harmless terra firma, while grass is a nightmarish field of metal thorns, snapping and knifing underfoot. Worse yet, a splinter of grass lodged in boot or flesh maintains its impossible inertia, practically trapping itself there. An unlucky configuration of three such splinters buried deep out of sight in this visitor's left foot nearly caused her to spend much longer than she would have preferred in an otherwise pastoral mountaintop tableau.

The greatest hazard of all is cumulative: each of these physical constraints---the cold, the muffle of sound and scent, the slow movement of light, the weight of all substance---slowly worsens the longer you spend in the ____[Cartography]. Though the exact parameters vary in a way not yet predictable, to a newly-arrived visitor another visitor already there for only hours may appear to be moving with twice the difficulty and be even slower to react to change. Attempts to aid someone in that state must overpower the increased resistance the victim is facing. Of course, remain for long enough and the tourist becomes a permanent resident, as immobile as the rest of the scene.

Visitors sealed into a tableau, artifacts left behind, or any successful attempts to move or bend lighter objects are the only known scenarios in which the state of things in this lamina may not be true to the outside multiverse. Though it is an unlikely scenario given the infinite spread of space and time represented here, this fact provides a tiny seed of doubt behind the assumption that a tableau accurately reflects a real happening.

Lastly, you have read that this realm contains even itself. What does that mean? This has been experimentally proven: tableau have been found depicting the ____[Cartography], that is to say, tableau of explorers visiting a tableau, and even, in one tragic recorded case, tableau of an explorer finding a tableau of explorers visiting a tableau, which will be discussed shortly.

## Culture & Paradigm

Unique among all of the laminae TODO(is this true)[], there appear to be no petitioners who make the ____[Cartography] their final residence. The only beings who seem at home here are the rilmani, occasionally sighted by visitors from a distance, their slender, iridescent flesh wrapped in cloaks, carefully inspecting some detail of a tableau. Apparently unencumbered by the oppressive nature of the lamina, they are swifter than any visitor and gently depart when sighted. Whether they are natives or simply frequent guests is unknown, but their presence is in keeping with their role as watchmen of multiversal balance.

Amongst those few scholars, mercenaries, and obsessives familiar with this lamina, however, a small and wildly dangerous cottage industry has sprung up, accompanied by a certain camaraderie. The ____[Cartography] is something of a holy grail that, if tamed, would hold untold promise. It is reminiscent of that fable of the near-infinite library that contains all possible books of a certain size, which are mostly gibberish but must by necessity have among their member all past and future books, some of great knowledge and power.

The case of the ____[Cartography], however, is more tantalizing, since some methods hold promise of guiding you closer to a desired moment! The beauty is that once the desired tableau has been reached, especially if this was achieved with a permanent portal that lets visitors come and go as they please to avoid the gradual burden of the place, it can be explored with none of the hazards of the original place. Enemy defenses or the location of powerful relics in a hostile environment can be explored and mapped out at leisure. One can travel to places normally inaccessible. With a suit fashioned from lotus leaves or shark skin you can swim through fog, and with a large kind of solid snowshoe you can walk on clouds if you keep moving. Lava is lukewarm to the touch and completely solid, acid too is firm and harmless, traps are never sprung, magical defenses hang helplessly in the air, treacherous paths never crumble,

Here are some desired moments your traveler has had explained excitedly to her:

- TODO
- TODO

discuss groups trying, how it works: complex ritual *sometimes* guides journey in. you do in certain place hoping to see that place in certain time, but sometimes it latches on to an arbitrary thing, like your boots, and takes you to a frozen scene of cobbler making them, or of your boots decaying at bottom of a river, and now you're stuck cause water is treacherous. anything can be picked up, maybe a wisp of hair, you can end up anywhere those particles were or will be. or it goes wrong and you end up in far future or past, crushed by the change in landscape.

- due to the absolute immobility of most matter, even as minor an obstacle as a closed door or window left insufficiently ajar can thwart the most dedicated of visitors, though a curtain of fine sheer silk can, with enough bludgeoning, be made to part way.

### Navigation

As with every other lamina, apertures connecting to locations in the ____[Cartography] are scattered across the multiverse, many residing in Soblei. The vast, vast majority of these lead to uninteresting tableau or barren landscapes of the past or future or remote present. Attempts to travel to a particular time and location in this folded infinite spacetime require incredible power and are time-consuming, expensive, prone to error, and frequently fatal.

I have copied here the best efforts of TODO/name (scholar studying NNP) to summarize the complex mechanics of travel to, from, and within the ____[Cartography]:

> If one wishes to reach a specific tableau, there are three options:
>
> 1. Find an existing portal that happens to go to the right period of time, and then make one's way from there to one's desired location without dying.
> 2. Use the standard teleportation spells and rituals, which are wildly inaccurate in this case and prone to failure. In the event one achieves the desired location, one will mostly likely not achieve the desired time. Once there, one will slowly die, and upon returning to one's home world before death, one will be unlikely to successfully return to the same tableau.
> 3. Attempt to modify an existing portal to point to a new tableau. This is prone to catastrophic failure, but if one succeeds, one may come and go as one pleases, which reduces the chance of dying.

If you are interested in the particulars I have copied here more detailed notes:

> **Portals**
>
> Pre-existing portals to the ____[Cartography] are as uncommon. Most are of unknown provenance, probably the act of deities or demigods, the Wish of a magic user of vast power, unexpected cataclysms, eons of ritual, etc. They work as normal.
>
> I am aware of some successful attempts to bend an existing portal to point to a different time or location, but I am aware of no attempts that achieved both at once, and aware of many attempts that have resulted in the destruction of the portal and/or everything in the presence of the portal at the time the attempt was made.
>
> Temporary portals or gates to or from or within the ____[Cartography] are almost impossible to aim accurately as I will describe shortly, but they last for normal amounts of time (as measured from the outside).
>
> **Travel within the ____[Cartography]**
>
> The separation of laminae and cardinal worlds is preserved in the ____[Cartography]. I am lucky to have in my laboratory a gate to the coronation of Prince Uyik in his resplendent palace on the Elemental Plane of Mirrors. From that tableau, simpler teleportation efforts that only work within the same realm will only take one elsewhere in the Elemental Plane of Mirrors, while inter-planar transport will take one to any realm. However, no matter how one gets there, one will remain at the moment of the coronation of Print Uyik.
>
> <!-- plane of mirrors: https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Plane_of_Mirrors -->
>
> Teleportation within the ____[Cartography] is subject to the same hazards and inaccuracies a teleportation normally is, but the rate and severity of mishaps is notably increased.
>
> The only known way to move in time from within is to do some foolish action that creates a tear in reality, for example by placing a portable hole in a bag of holding. This will fling the perpetrator and those near him to a random moment in time, but usually roughly in the same place.
>
> **Travel to the ____[Cartography]**
>
> very inaccurate location, totally random time. helps both time and place to have object related, but you might end up at time/place of something with distant provenance but directly physical relation.
>
> **Travel from the ____[Cartography]**
>
> more inaccurate location, sometimes random time. again helps both time and place to have object related

## Guide

### History

"History" is a laughable concept for a realm that contains within it the entire history of the multiverse, but some moments stand out as

TODO

#### Recursiveness

This latter has been recorded once, with tragic end. The famous pair of scholars TODO (pair of explorers) spent a long time studying this realm, primarily learning how to visit specific tableau. explorer who was frozen, there is a portal to the moment in which he was frozen. people were able to reach separate moments which show frozen moment in time from the expedition in which he was lost. like A was frozen and B made it out, and B was able to find a scene showing both A and B, B seeing herself failing to save A. heartbreak! If they'd seen this first could they have prevented? segue into determinism stuff. The moment they saw this scene, they instantly understood what was about to happen.

someone seeing a tableau that represents their future death?

#### TODO

TODO some famous (chance) meeting here?

### Locations

#### TODO coliseum

A large cabinet under the bar at a private back room in the grimy Lukewarm Caldera in Soblei leads to possibly the most hospitable spot in the ____[Cartography]. The pub is of course named after the portal, which leads to nothing less than the mouth of an active volcano in the aftermath of a vast eruption. TODO describe sea

While the ____[Cartography] is a famously bone-shatteringly freezing place, and the center of a bonfire is merely extremely cold, magma flows can approach pleasantly cool to the touch. And the center of this molten cataclysm is balmy enough to work up a sweat. Better yet, no one knows when or how the enormous amounts of smoke and ash and igneous chunks that must have hung in the air were cleaned out, but the atmosphere in and around the entire caldera is clean as the TODO(place as clean as plane of air)[Plane of Air]. A practically solid wall of billowing ash forms a barrier that begins just a couple dozen paces over the lip of the edge of the caldera, as well as overhead covering the whole opening. TODO would it be ash, also how bright

coliseum for interesting combat

inside caldera of volcano and it's like... cool but fine. and they laboriously cleared out the air of particles so you can move easily. coliseum, or another place?

#### TODO

plane of mirrors, unknown future or past. planar transport to all realms except some (like elemental planes) fails - because they don't exist? is this some ancient primordial past or degenerate future where only element planes exist?

(maybe quote from guy)

it's BEAUTIFUL and complex. the air is vibrantly clean and environment geometric and clear cut, so while the cold remains, physical navigation is easy. it is days before any encumbrance is noted at all. of course, the elemental planes, except for that of air, are so full of stuff as to be near instant death traps.

____ scholar in old age has given up on exploring the ____[Cartography], and is now attempting to catalog the formal and complex society of blah city in the Plane of Mirrors. attempting to decipher their written language but no progress, but their visual art is astounding.

the slow light affect is CREEPY. you are constantly catching glimpses of yourself in the past, sometimes reflected across dozens of mirrors through an unexpected angle, hours ago. guy has gone in with friends etc., but he swears that he has caught moving glimpses of people he doesn't recognize, but no way of knowing if it's ancient light reflected in some arduous route of visitors from years before he obtained the portal, or if another portal exists or someone is somehow sneaking in. attempts to trace the source are through complex passageways are hopeless.

really hard to navigate, leaves breadcrumbs (what kind?)

### Figures & Groups

anything apart from that guild?

### Festivals & Traditions

ritual revisiting of past event. snowy mountain where something religious or whatever retrieved. or maybe they were saved, vanquished enemy, etc. it's like hajj. super snowy and difficult and you're meant to forge through snow and bring some back, though many routes are cleared out over time and good for the lazy or infirm or less dedicated. but HUGE mountain so even untold years there's plenty. snow on feet as well. do you craft your own suit/armor? passed down? shield?

### Rumors & Mysteries

#### Extent in Space

TODO(replace Sigil and Outlands and spire and EVERYTHING with Soblei)[]

To be clear, the ____[Cartography] doesn't reflect only cardinal worlds. It holds everything---the Inner and Outer Planes, the Astral and the Ethereal, wildspace, the Hinterlands, all of it, even the Far Realm. The one exception, perhaps, is Sigil. Tableau of the Outlands are plentiful (notably, magic is not suppressed in tableau there) from which of course you can see Sigil atop the infinite Spire. But since the Spire is infinitely tall, there seems no way to reach Sigil. Must it be there, if it can be seen, replicated in total detail, holding all its secrets? For the slim price of overcoming this lamina's natural hazards, we could explore the City of Doors at leisure, unmolested by the Lady or her servants!

If Sigil is here, why have all attempts to reach tableau there failed? One theory is that the giant torus visible from the Outlands is not actually Sigil, which itself resides in some pocket demiplane. This wouldn't directly explain the lack of Sigil tableau, but would allow for the apparent visibility of Sigil from tableau of the Outlands without Sigil's interior being accessible, while some other explanation must be found for while Sigil alone is missing.

#### Extent in Time

The endless expanse of time appears to be fully represented. Tableau of ancient primordial scenes have been found, before the gods as we know them were formed. Distant futures have been found too: metropolises of teeming utopias and dystopias (but absent motion and social contact, it may be hard to tell which is which) as well as cold entropic wastelands. Technological marvels would reveal themselves if only their inventors could be spoken with, or their inventions were

future moments seem to exist, but it's unclear if this shows the future is deterministic, or if multiple future moments exist. no one has yet found two incompatible future moments, but are actively searching. (example of close call but not clear if incompatible)

#### Passage of Time

Light travels about 300,000,000m/s. Time passes about a billion times slower here, so light travels about 1ft/second. hold your hand out and move it, takes about 1 second before you see it move. So extremely cold because molecules moving billionth as fast, everything is basically absolute zero. No sound, unless you're really, really close. Moving is hard and gets harder. Touch works normal. Smell works but never travels. Maybe it's like "soul juice" that allows things to move, but which light doesn't have, but an arrow does.

### Visiting

<!--

## GM Guide

### Conditions

Most dangers of the original world are neutralized here, leaving only the natural dangers of the ____[Cartography]. The only things that remain harmful are:

- Pointy and sharp things still damage, often worse than they would normally due to their stiffness (e.g. grass)
- Crushing: if you for some reason end up trapped in some way, it's still a problem
- Suffocation: if you are somewhere with no air breathable by you, you will suffocate
- Heat: even the center of the plane of fire is merely warm, maybe a little hot. The center of the sun will still kill you.
- Noxious fumes: Gases behave normally, so carbon monoxide, for instance, would be harmful. Of course, if there's no oxygen (or whatever you need) you will suffocate. Noxious things in the air that are solid particulates (ash, say) will not cause the normal harm for they do not interact the way they normally would, but they will accumulate in your lungs (unless you take precautions) and slow you down and even tear at your insides, and any particulates that you bring back with you into the regular world will then do any harm they would do at that point.
- Things which, just by their mere sight, would driver a viewer mad are still dangerous to behold, for instance in the Far Realms. The effect tends to be less powerful though, and visitors with much preparation who are very familiar with the conditions of tableau are able to train and steel themselves to treat it is a harmless facsimile or the original.

How long until stuff bogs you down? A very dusty room or thick fog is challenging immediately, and within hours impenetrable. On the clearest of days you would move freely at first, within hours encumbered by tiny dust, pollen, other particulates, and by a day or two would be trapped.

### Transport

Permanent Teleportation Circle requires casting every day for 100 years. Existing permanent circles on the lamina that you know the sigils of you can go to that location, but utterly random time.

Plane Shift works for location, but random time.

Teleport works as normal, but the "same plane" means same plane as you're currently on in that tableau, and same slice of time.

The Gate spell doesn't let anything enter the plane, only works to leave the plane.

Wish works to teleport in to a desired location precisely, but still only 20% chance of the exact moment you wanted, 20% it's +/- minutes, 20% chance it's +/- hours, 20% chance it's +/- days, 20% it's +/- years. Wish may also alter an existing portal to change its location precisely, and its time with the same % chances of error, and it remains permanent.
