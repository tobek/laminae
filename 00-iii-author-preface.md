This visitor's second favorite spot in the multiverse is TODO (nice description of place and people). (Her favorite, of course, awaits your discovery within these pages.)

The twenty-seven laminae are unimaginably vast, and all the superlatives of the multiverse lie within their folds. On REF[the Inevitability](CND) stands an Unraveller who holds simultaneously in her awareness each egg being cooked in that instant across all of reality, while on REF[the Unfolding](LNC) original copies of all the greatest architectural wonders of the multiverse crowd at the feet of the Scaffold. TODO

societies take all kinds of people but in the laminae they cluster together. this works sometimes and doesn't work others, but it relies [does it?] on the universe having all types
