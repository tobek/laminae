summary: An incomprehensible realm of deafening harmonics and shimmering geometries that shift and overlap, the Procedure brims with the zeal of the prismatic Looms, who diligently arrange and replay the affairs of mortal worlds in an effort to bring about a formation they call "the Pattern".

intro: |

    For the sequential reader this REF[lamina](laminae) may be an unusual introduction: the Procedure is one of the most incomprehensible of realms, and, while not so dangerous as REF[CGC] or REF[CEP], it is not a place intended for mortal visitors, whose faculties seem insufficient for perceiving it. Upon arrival your vision is that of tremendous forms, shimmering and iridescent and overlapping one another and you, accompanied by a cacophony of blaring tones, discordant to the ear yet perfectly arranged, appearing to ever rise in pitch. Merely turning your head causes these shapes and sounds to shift in unpredictable ways.

    Navigating the Procedure seems impossible, but it is at the very least safe: the landscape contours around you to keep you steady, meeting your feet with solid ground and even supporting you should you stumble.^[Closing your eyes makes walking far more comfortable.] Though there is no getting used to the harmonics, after some time the eye learns to pick out meaningful elements in the holographic jumble: prismatic figures deep in conversation, repetitive geometric landforms, and crystalline scaffolds. The REF[petitioners] that reside here, known as Looms, are everywhere once you come to see them, luminous forms with faces like marbled ink in water, willing to patiently speak with visitors in warm tonal voices that arrive as if from many mouths and directions at once.

    The Looms say that they are in the process of creating "the Pattern", and this visitor will do her best to relate their description of what that entails. Everywhere they are busy with this task, instructing the gods of REF[cardinal] worlds in their ways and cultivating mortal cultures that they believe likely to give rise to the shapes they seek. They then pull beads from the great web of being into this realm to overlay them in potential patterns on the reticulated structures of their observatories, or to temporarily inhabit them and play out their ramifications before councils of sympathy.

    Observing this process you will find Looms taking on personal roles and abstract forces: a group of three may seem to reflect your mother speaking to you and a childhood friend, playing out some scenario that you recognize, while to another visitor this same scene may be observed as two scholars debating with a personification of jealousy. These interpretations are simultaneously correct. From the perspective of Looms the cardinal worlds exist as a substrate atop which they can build and observe patterns. Their simulations and discoveries unfold at a breathtaking scale and the Procedure teems with experimentation and calculation and the trying on of things.

    None could comprehensibly describe what their Pattern might be like nor what it is for, but concluding a lengthy conversation one Loom, ascertaining that this visitor intended to share her understanding in the present text, asked that she record a final articulation:

    > <gpt>Why don't you think of the Pattern as that which is coming, that which has been approaching from all eternity, that which will someday arrive, the ultimate fruit of a tree whose leaves you are? You must project this birth into the ages that are coming into existence, and live your life as a painful and lovely day in the history of a great pregnancy. Don't you see how everything that happens is again and again a beginning, and could it not begin the Pattern, since, in itself, starting is always so beautiful? If it is to be the most perfect, must not what is less perfect precede it, so that it can choose itself out of fullness and superabundance? Must it not be the last, so that it can include everything in itself, and what meaning would we have if that for which we are longing for has already existed? We start that which you will not live to see, just as your ancestors could not live to see you. And yet they, who passed away long ago, still exist in you, as predisposition, as burden upon your fate, as murmuring blood, and as gesture that rises up from the depths of time and reaches for the Pattern.</gpt> <!-- Rainer Maria Rilke -->

    It is difficult to describe the sensation of hearing these words from every direction refracted through the harmonic crescendo of the Procedure. In mere ink they seem to only grasp weakly at meaning, yet the Loom that spoke them did so with such precision and grace as to impart upon this visitor some conviction of their significance, along with no small sadness at the impossibility of transmuting the experience into text. This instance is not the only such challenge that befalls the present work.

what's the point?

- too much of a good thing gets weird
- really disorienting/mysterious but they are definitely up to something!!
- this place is not made for mortals. "be not afraid" biblical angel vibe
- incoming godhead, they're creating it
- is there any possible coherent goal of "fixing everything"? i mean no - do they disagree? but improvement is possible

- looking for the chosen one - in an interesting way
- formulaic plays, constantly changing the formulae, picking up pieces of indra's net, trying them on


Maybe they have some rumored and controversial deal/symbiosis with CED?

    - rilke quote about god coming
        + Why don’t you think of him as the one who is coming, who has been approaching from all eternity, the one who will someday arrive, the ultimate fruit of a tree whose leaves we are? What keeps you from projecting his birth into the ages that are coming into existence, and living your life as a painful and lovely day in the history of a great pregnancy? Don’t you see how everything that happens is again and again a beginning, and couldn’t it be His beginning, since, in itself, starting is always so beautiful? If he is the most perfect one, must not what is less perfect precede him, so that he can choose himself out of fullness and superabundance? Must he not be the last one, so that he can include everything in himself, and what meaning would we have if he whom we are longing for has already existed?
        + As bees gather honey, so we collect what is sweetest out of all things and build Him. Even with the trivial, with the insignificant (as long as it is done out of love) we begin, with work and with the repose that comes afterward, with a silence or with a small solitary joy, with everything that we do alone, without anyone to join or help us, we start Him whom we will not live to see, just as our ancestors could not live to see us. And yet they, who passed away long ago, still exist in us, as predisposition, as burden upon our fate, as murmuring blood, and as gesture that rises up from the depths of time.

        + "I could make a good argument for it being an emergent phenomenon. The prophecy might go: "A society of this structure in this environment will inevitably produce a hero of this character. When you see him, don't murder him. Help him along." It's still birth lottery, but shared." https://twitter.com/AaronPogue/status/1444289931162103808

    - doppelganger
    - "The Buddhist allegory of "Indra's Net" tells of an endless net of threads throughout the universe, the horizontal threads running through space, the vertical ones through time. At every crossing of threads is an individual, and every individual is a crystal bead. The great light of "Absolute Being" illuminates and penetrates every crystal bead; moreover, every crystal bead reflects not only the light from every other crystal in the net---but also every reflection of every reflection throughout the universe." GEB. NGP? probably better. maybe exists in CNP? LGC?
    - something where everything is like a play, or all interactions are formulaic - NGP probably, could be LGC?

    - realm outside of cause-and-effect? maybe lawful or neutral somehow? CNC or CGC. used in CNC but open to it going elsewhere. LGC?
    - GEB, achilles gets one meta wish, asks for wish not to be granted, and then "an event — or is 'event' the word for it? — takes place which cannot be described, and hence no attempt will be made to describe it." the result is that the universe crashes, and the characters wind up somewhere totally different - LGC, it crashed in the past
