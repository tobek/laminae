what's the point?

- too much of a good thing gets weird
- really disorienting but they are definitely up to something!!
- this place is not made for mortals
-->

Maybe they have some rumored and controversial deal/symbiosis with CED?

crystalline structure

a surprisingly exhausting, crushing place? Too much energy? Conduit should maybe be missing from this one or CEC or CED or LEC. W40k Terra? Or crystalline? Some deal/symbiosis with CED. oral history in wisdom, maybe in clothing and everything. incoming godhead, they're creating it

Some enormous oral history (perhaps song in unknown language) that everyone learns and memorizes but only elite understand what it means - laypeople are only as necessary initiated into bits of it where they learn this thing they've been doing/saying all their life actually means XYZ "The Retelling" (something like eulexia - but song). this could also totally be LGP, maybe better as LGP

@conaw tweet: "Heaven is the feedback loop where the good keeps getting better"

"be not afraid" biblical angel vibe? shimmering irridescent, totally huge and overwhelming, blaring overlapping shephard tone melodies, discordant to the ear but perfectly arranged. massive structures twirling and some extra-dimensional fashion, totally incomprehensible. cannot be properly perceived

they are *BUSY* but what are they up to? so much stuff going on

one of the weirdest

    - "Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don't be afraid." ― Frederick Buechner CGP? NGC. LGC
    - rilke quote about god coming
        + Why don’t you think of him as the one who is coming, who has been approaching from all eternity, the one who will someday arrive, the ultimate fruit of a tree whose leaves we are? What keeps you from projecting his birth into the ages that are coming into existence, and living your life as a painful and lovely day in the history of a great pregnancy? Don’t you see how everything that happens is again and again a beginning, and couldn’t it be His beginning, since, in itself, starting is always so beautiful? If he is the most perfect one, must not what is less perfect precede him, so that he can choose himself out of fullness and superabundance? Must he not be the last one, so that he can include everything in himself, and what meaning would we have if he whom we are longing for has already existed?
        + As bees gather honey, so we collect what is sweetest out of all things and build Him. Even with the trivial, with the insignificant (as long as it is done out of love) we begin, with work and with the repose that comes afterward, with a silence or with a small solitary joy, with everything that we do alone, without anyone to join or help us, we start Him whom we will not live to see, just as our ancestors could not live to see us. And yet they, who passed away long ago, still exist in us, as predisposition, as burden upon our fate, as murmuring blood, and as gesture that rises up from the depths of time.
    - 128. ...It won’t take forever, nothing takes forever, but so many things take longer than we have. (NNP? CGD? LGC?)

- questions
- future research
- possible environment
    - non-euclidean/visual distortion like Rorik Smith polyhedral pics or something (NNC? LGC, LNP)
    - Everything is black and white - maybe CED? or NNP. or... LGC or LGP? CNP, LED
    - Medieval illuminated manuscripts LED? LGC?
- possible elements
    - oracle(s) maybe in CNP? CGC somehow? NEP? LGC
    - looking for the chosen one - in an interesting way (LGC LGP)
        + "I could make a good argument for it being an emergent phenomenon. The prophecy might go: "A society of this structure in this environment will inevitably produce a hero of this character. When you see him, don't murder him. Help him along." It's still birth lottery, but shared." https://twitter.com/AaronPogue/status/1444289931162103808
        + society-wide processes to breed out chosen people/breed - this is bene gesserit right?
        + rilke quote about god as the one who is coming
        + “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.” - 2 Peter 3:3-4
    - doppelganger
    - "The Buddhist allegory of "Indra's Net" tells of an endless net of threads throughout the universe, the horizontal threads running through space, the vertical ones through time. At every crossing of threads is an individual, and every individual is a crystal bead. The great light of "Absolute Being" illuminates and penetrates every crystal bead; moreover, every crystal bead reflects not only the light from every other crystal in the net---but also every reflection of every reflection throughout the universe." GEB. NGP? probably better. maybe exists in CNP? LGC?
    - something where everything is like a play, or all interactions are formulaic - NGP probably, could be CGC - or LGC?
    - One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move (NNC, LGD, CNC, maybe even CNP, LED, NEP, LGC)
    - All beings part of a single collective hive intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic mind, or are actually different minds) - should probably be NEC or NEP. gosh could be NGD if nothing else. LED. CGC maybs behind the scenes. oh definitely could be LGC
    - "you: human creativity is a glorious, nigh-divine faculty / me: a human brain is a puncture wound in the fabric of reality that monsters from outside the world can use to claw their way into it / we are not the same" - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1469396883118477316 NEC, CNC, CGC, LGC as some kind of warning?
    - "It is your [our] job to teach the gods proper morals." https://twitter.com/CurlOfGradient/status/1108326892053123075
    - some valuable resource intruders want to use... LEP? LGC?
    - <gpt>The ruins of an ancient civilization. The inhabitants share their ancestors’ obsession with perfecting a single simulation of a city, endlessly adapting it to reflect new scientific, cultural, and social insights.</gpt> LEP LGC
    - realm outside of cause-and-effect? maybe lawful or neutral somehow? LEP maybe, or else CNC or CGC. used in CNC but open to it going elsewhere. LGC?
    - GEB, achilles gets one meta wish, asks for wish not to be granted, and then "an event — or is 'event' the word for it? — takes place which cannot be described, and hence no attempt will be made to describe it." the result is that the universe crashes, and the characters wind up somewhere totally different - LGC, it crashed in the past
    - strange loops
        + Synthesis facet. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP?
    - emergence LGC
    - comp sci solvability LGC?
