summary: The Macula is a pitch-dark realm where every shred of light and substance has long since been utilized by the alien and fractal Oriels to build curling, spectacular palaces in which they warp their minds and bodies in pursuit of ever more esoteric experiences of beauty.

intro: |

    All the light and color has long since been slicked out of this realm: the ground is a desert of black pebbles and the stars, they say, were plucked from the Macula's now-empty sky to adorn crowns and capes of the Oriels. Curling towers and palaces punctuate the blankness, gleaming like jewels scattered in ash, and in each of these a microcosm of fantasy blossoms in which the Oriels---alien and fractal and shatteringly striking beings---mould their minds and bodies in the pursuit of visceral beauty.

    Some Oriels seek an objective beauty, constructed according to elegant geometric proofs laid out for all to see, but beauty of course is an experience that unfolds in the beholder, and so Oriels warp and transfigure themselves in order to behold ever more esoteric and intense experiences of beauty, inventing philosophies and bodies and states of mind to inhabit. Others pursue beauty outside their own selves, in the breeding of outlandish creatures, or in erotic pursuits, or in the invention of musical structures, mathematical theories, languages and scripts and social experimentations that rival those of REF[the Brink](CGP). No natural light suffuses the Macula, and so even vision is an act of Oriel agency: the harnessing of light here is a universal art, one that provides another axis along which Oriels distinguish, judge, and focus their efforts.

    No other lamina channels the gales of REF[Creation] with such intensity and precision,^[Perhaps one could argue that, in it's own narrower and more practical way, the Bloom's REF[Islet Conservatory](CEC#the-islet-conservatory) could contend for this superlative.] wielding them as hammers on the blasted anvils of the Macula and their own bodies. Narcissism runs thick and is equally well harnessed---and warranted: Oriels are unforgiving with their judgments, and so all know their own standing. They are often cruel, but not for the sake of cruelty, only sparing no patience before their callings. For those REF[petitioners] that arrive not blessed with beauty, they may shape themselves accordingly or, along complex stratifications of Oriel society, find their place serving others or bearing the honor of being transmuted into materials for those more worthy of their substance.

    Far from the ornate clusters of Oriel abodes, REF[laminal](laminals) titans are occasionally found wandering slowly in the blackness. Oriels avoid them and could report little to this visitor except to note a distant feature known as the Cleave: <gpt>a mighty mountain split evenly down its center. On one side of this mountain reportedly stands a gorgeous and luminescent woman eternally chiseling the stone into perfect statues of the most beautiful figures. The other half is populated by those statuesque giants who end their meanderings here lusting after her, and in doing so their bodies and minds slowly deform and harden.</gpt>

sufficiently weird beauty is indistinguishiable from perversion (tweet and link here!)

<!--
what's the point?

- WOW incredibly beautiful just WOW
- some broken eggs to make this omelette
- intimidating
- requires narcissism, which bears fruits
- beauty is complicated - objective/subjective, dependent/disinterested, etc.
- hyper-sensitivity to relative power/beauty, judgment, shame -> incredible beauty
- sacrifice in its pursuit
- beauty is in the whole experience of it

- name
	- The Macula
- demonym
	- Oriels
- environment
	- pebbly black desert and blank sky since in the past all resources in environment were used? even the stars plucked out of the sky to decorate. so everything stands out even more
	- no weather or seasons
	- no light
- culture
    - "Beauty is an unalloyed good, a good until itself. Likewise strength." - Zero HP Lovecraft
	- Barbarella decadence
	- palaces & monuments
	- dark eldar
	- bottom x% constantly sacrificed/transmuted? LEP LEC
		- can choose to be sacrificed OR transmuted into some more beautiful form (grotesque ish)
	- led by the most beautiful
	- varying standards of beauty, some impenetrable to outsiders
	- celebrating masculine vs feminine vs other - various categorizations?
	- different forms of beauty (math, music, etc)
	- light bearing
	- experiment with their lives to change conceptions of beauty
	- perfection enforced by punishment from judges?
	- some ageplay thing?

info gathering

- questions:
	- who's judging?
	- how do they interact with the cardinal?
		- inspiring cardinals?
	- power and knowledge as well? maybe power. too similar to athletes?
		+ i guess beauty of abstract concepts sure, and in form
- research
	- read nietzsche, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty
	- aesthetics
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_fluency_theory_of_aesthetic_pleasure
- elements
	- selective breeding - chosen-one-ish, but different
	- "a musk that makes you want to stand near them, doing nothing." -- http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/10/gender-and-representation-in-warhammers.html - LEC?
	- mirroring/doppelgangering
	- sex
	    + sex ed: everyone tries everything and then chooses what they're into
	    + a failed free love and sex world, because "taboo is revealed to be as fundamental aspect of sexual arousal as the unknown is to the intellectual. The people demand a strict morality police after an era of total acceptance drains all the fun out of it. Everyone is fully expected to both seek out sexual thrills and aid in the swift punishment of anyone who seeks out sexual thrills"
	- caste systems signaled by fashion and mannerisms
	- sexual proclivities replace other tribal markers and are increasingly fractured
	- many sex partners but only one friend, good form to break up before making another, cheating, etc. (some kind of power-couple thing)
	- Keynesian beauty contest? yeah i mean who is judging
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest
        - "It is not a case of choosing those [faces] that, to the best of one's judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees."
- notes
	- "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239
	- interaction with cardinals? "person with taste can observe things going on around them and identify points of interest. by doing this, they make the reality they inhabit more interesting. you can create real value this way. it has an emotional impact on people. you might use words, or photographs, whatever. you could maybe think of this as being a "beauty-worker". you create beauty by identifying it, contemplating it, understanding it, accentuating it .if a shaman is a meaning-worker, maybe an artist is a beauty-worker. or a certain subset of artists" - https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1464230021254377475
- research notes
	- beauty = "pleasurable to perceive"
	- beauty is transcendental
	- objective and subjective but also intersubjective (depending on group, keynesian beauty contest)
	- dependent beauty: an ox that is beautiful as an ox but not as a horse, or a photograph that is beautiful because it depicts a beautiful building but that lacks beauty generally speaking because of its low quality
	- could you circumvent the assertion of one's beauty by developing yourself to have different standards of beauty, without faking it?
	- the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion (disinterested pleasure), which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity (not disinterested pleasure)
	- a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty due to her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work. can allow responses to beautiful things to lack pleasure while insisting that all beautiful things merit pleasure, that aesthetic pleasure is the only appropriate response to them
	- explaining beauty according to its role in sexual selection - does this still hold here? guess it could come from past
	- free beauty = independent of what the object ought to be. dependent beauty = beautifully fitted for a particular purpose
	- narcissus - character and flower, "i grow numb" interesting
		- "there is no clarity on whether a flower is named for the myth or the myth for the flower, or if there is any true connection at all"
		- "Pliny the Elder wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (ναρκάω narkao, 'I grow numb'), not the youth."
    - "Any material object which can give us pleasure in the simple contemplation of its outward qualities without any direct and definite exertion of the intellect, I call in some ways, or in some degree, beautiful." - Ruskin, Modern Painters
