Cathartic sacrificial/purging rituals? Celebratory graveyard/memorializing? maybe swap with NGD

Sacrificers: bring something you are done with or want to get rid of (or celebrate in a blaze of glory) and a ritual will be created around it, its essence split up and dispersed. Or maybe like a graveyard (could swap with NGD) where everything is done appropriate justice, eulogized by incredible orators. Bloodletting.

Blissful letting go. But the thing you are forced to let go of is rarely the thing you came to let go of.
