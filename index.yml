Hierarchy Empathy:

        name: The Bauble? The Procedure?
        demonym:
        summary: |
            *?* a surprisingly exhausting, crushing place? Too much energy? Conduit should maybe be missing from this one or CEC or CED or LEC. W40k Terra? Or crystalline? Some deal/symbiosis with CED. oral history in wisdom, maybe in clothing and everything. incoming godhead, they're creating it

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Empathy Equilibrium (LGP)':
        name: The Concordance, The Positioning, The Arrangement, The Procedure
        demonym: Archons, Valiants
        summary: |
            An answer to the question "is suffering needed to give context to happiness?" - their answer is "no". A perfect civilization that gently guides any visitor or resident towards benevolent perfection. Idealized Japan?

        demonym: Avatars, Archons, Ardents, Apeirons, Pyreans
        summary: |
            Resting place for famous champions (martial and otherwise) who wish to engage with evil one more time, but only if the challenge is perfectly matched such that it results in the hero simultaneously succeeding and perishing. Visitors make their cases requesting help from these mythical heros, and bookkeepers assess the odds that it will be sufficiently valiant and perilous.


Synthesis Empathy:

        name: The Epiphany?
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Self-improvement? Keepers of the "universal story". Is the insight real, or is it the feeling of insight. They're insufferable, but you can't blame them. Pilgrimages and crowds. How can so many experience it without infinite queues? Everyone should experience it but it's so cringe some people never will. They try to optimize this but can't? Or no, do they evangelize or no? maybe they don't but others do. Some struggle here, in the way that IJ is a struggle against addictiveness. goal is to motivate one to do better. this place should be beautiful, like the mechanical monk image

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Empathy Equilibrium (NGP)':
        name: The Braid

        demonym: Apeirons
        summary: |
            Rivalry with LGP, believe suffering and risk of failure is required for happiness. Burnt out minds and exultant savants, psychedelic natural disasters tearing and regenerating the landscape. Burning manish

        name: The Unfolding
        demonym: Architects
        summary: |
            Artists and engineers that freely architect all the most famous constructions in existence. Will work with anyone on any project - all things, irrespective of emotional or moral content, are opportunities for commemoration, challenge, creation, and beauty. Islands tended to by Patterners split and join to create archipelagos and continents spread across the Glass Ocean, where the enormous automaton Wind Shifters interlock and glide across empty waters.

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Utility Equilibrium (LNP)':
        name: The Essentialism
        demonym: Archivists
        summary: |
            Collecting everything in a crystalline library hive, for cataloging and categorization according to infinitely varied sets of overlapping ontologies, none of which can be argued to be a universally useful or applicable paradigm. Also, free storage of stuff they don't have? Lost and found?

        link: true
        name: The Instrument
        demonym: Moilers
        summary: |
            OCD to its most extreme. Different factions OCD about different things, and cities built around them, e.g. cleaning things to the bone/disintegration, or smoothing until nothing remains, or analysis until meaninglessness, or repetition until nonsense


Synthesis Utility:

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Creation (NNC)':
        name: The Asymmetry
        demonym: Grains
        summary: |
            Sculptors + research/exploration in order to predict how their sculptures/creations can nudge everything towards some kind of balance, keeping endless ledgers of outcomes and future adjustments needed. Everything ever made was made here in its prototypical form?

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Equilibrium (NNP)':

        name: The Cartography, The Exhibition, The Testimony
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Entire multiverse laid out like endless chess set, everything recreated in 1-to-1 scale in grayscale, nothing ever moving. For every instant in time, this plane contains one complete copy reality of occupying the full space it requires. This makes it really really hard to find anything, because every physical location is represented by an infinite number of snapshots of it over time, but if you can find anything, you can study a specific moment with limitless time and attention, even the future.

    '◍◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Dissolution (NND)':
        link: true
        name: The Lucidity
        demonym: Precepts
        summary: |
            Obliterating zen monks aim for ultimate nothingness residing in blank palaces. Flawless control over their attention gives them otherwordly abilities. They occasionally gather outside their realm to perform lengthy ceremonies of "erasure" causing an unepected thing (an artifact, a memory, a person, a river, a civilization) to vanish at the end of the ceremony. Swap with NED? if not need something that pulls them away from pure power


Autonomy Utility:

    '◍◍○○○○ Autonomy Utility Creation (CNC)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            "Mutatorium" (fractal passageways where patient caretakers guide visitors through undertakings that cause drastic transformations that rarely go as planned)? Creative madness/art? Thieves (that... duplicate stuff?)? Lost and found? Artists?

    '◍◍◍○○○ Autonomy Utility Equilibrium (CNP)':
        name: The Wilt
        demonym: Blighted, Catatons
        summary: |
            Endless plain filled with extremely deep, geometric holes, each filled by one soul who remains motionless in apathy and solitude indefinitely. Holes slowly close up on their inhabitants, who don't mind. Extremely peaceful. Rarely, one will climb out and make a pilgrimage.

            OR new alignments: more like some peaceful apathetic limbo for loners? In which case CNP. Their holes are beautifully decorated, some are grassy patches with sun, silence and peace. Sometimes they sleep and the holes close up. Weirdly blank outside each hole.

        name: The Inevitability
        demonym: Unravellers
        summary: |
            Basically an embodiment of the second law of thermodynamics. They are the mechanism by which the multiverse ensures that entropy always increases. They organize into collectives around particular domains of entropy - rotting food, aging, combustion, political dissolution, broken furniture, romantic miscommunication, decomposing buried treasure, etc.

        summary: |
            In on the LGP/CGP questions? This or LEC has to be a cruel but beautiful and powerful and successful society, what ZHP wants.
            Paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible maze fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize, obsessively studying, the best at it. The culture has spiraled into paranoia (too much like LND?) - or just be a citystate? Or maybe the whole place but minus the paranoia. "optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs.

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Power Dissolution (LED)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Catacombs of industrious, hierarchical workers who invent convoluted schemes to unleash on the rest of existence. Not a single instance of a scheme being enacted has ever been observed. Are we not looking hard enough or are they obfuscating their work?

            the opposite of NGP - opposite of restorative justice? training, pacts of power, helping however but not honorably. Or dangerous beauty, Barbarella society?

        demonym: Grips
        summary: |
            Ouroboros - filled with giant ouroboros crashing through landscape eating everything and themselves. Inhabitants routinely eat themselves, but some force suffuses the place that makes everything regenerate?
