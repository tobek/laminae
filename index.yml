Hierarchy Empathy:

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Empathy Creation (LGC)':
        name: The Bauble? The Procedure? The Crescendo?
        demonym:
        summary: |
            *?* a surprisingly exhausting, crushing place? Too much energy? Conduit should maybe be missing from this one or CEC or CED or LEC. W40k Terra? Or crystalline? Some deal/symbiosis with CED. oral history in wisdom, maybe in clothing and everything. incoming godhead, they're creating it

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Empathy Equilibrium (LGP)':
        name: The Concordance, The Positioning, The Arrangement, The Procedure
        demonym: Archons, Valiants
        summary: |
            An answer to the question "is suffering needed to give context to happiness?" - their answer is "no". A perfect civilization that gently guides any visitor or resident towards benevolent perfection. Idealized Japan?

    '●◍◍○○○ Hierarchy Empathy Dissolution (LGD)':
        link: true
        name: The Ardence (The Lattice, The Reticulation (having the veins or nerves disposed like the threads of a net), The Braid)
        demonym: Avatars, Archons, Ardents, Apeirons, Pyreans
        summary: |
            Resting place for famous champions (martial and otherwise) who wish to engage with evil one more time, but only if the challenge is perfectly matched such that it results in the hero simultaneously succeeding and perishing. Visitors make their cases requesting help from these mythical heros, and bookkeepers assess the odds that it will be sufficiently valiant and perilous.


Hierarchy Utility:

    '●◍◍◍◍○ Hierarchy Utility Creation (LNC)':
        link: true
        name: The Unfolding
        demonym: Architects
        summary: |
            Artists and engineers that have architected all of the most famous constructions in existence, original copies of which fill archipelagos that spread across the Glass Ocean, where the enormous automaton wind shifters interlock and glide across empty waters.

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Utility Equilibrium (LNP)':
        name: The Essentialism
        demonym: Archivists
        summary: |
            Collecting everything in a crystalline library hive, for cataloging and categorization according to infinitely varied sets of overlapping ontologies, none of which can be argued to be a universally useful or applicable paradigm. Also, free storage of stuff they don't have? Lost and found?

    '●◍◍○○○ Hierarchy Utility Dissolution (LND)':
        link: true
        name: The Instrument
        demonym: Moilers
        summary: |
            The labyrinthine interior of a colossal automaton, the outside of which never been seen. The Instrument is tended to by the Moilers, whose culture has lost its knowledge of the automaton's purpose and operation, and as a result have devolved into industrious paranoia and neurosis.


Hierarchy Power:

    '●◍◍○○○ Hierarchy Power Creation (LEC)':
        link: true
        name: The Macula
        demonym: Oriels
        summary: |
            The Macula is a pitch-dark blank realm where every shred of light and substance has long since been utilized by the alien and fractal Oriels to build curling spectacular palaces in which they warp their minds and bodies in pursuit of ever more esoteric experiences of beauty.

    '◍○○○○○ Hierarchy Power Equilibrium (LEP)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            In on the LGP/CGP questions? This or LEC has to be a cruel but beautiful and powerful and successful society, what ZHP wants.
            Paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible maze fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize, obsessively studying, the best at it. The culture has spiraled into paranoia (too much like LND?) - or just be a citystate? Or maybe the whole place but minus the paranoia. "optimistic evil" like nazis, their vision of social progress at all costs.

    '◍◍○○○○ Hierarchy Power Dissolution (LED)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Catacombs of industrious, hierarchical workers who invent convoluted schemes to unleash on the rest of existence. Not a single instance of a scheme being enacted has ever been observed. Are we not looking hard enough or are they obfuscating their work?

        link: true
        name: The Bell
        demonym: Kalons
        summary: |
            Beautiful, storm-drenched mountains inhabited by the keepers of the "Universal Story," an indescribably transformative experience which they offer to visitors and continually seek to perfect.

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Empathy Equilibrium (NGP)':
        link: true
        name: The Braid
        demonym: Limns
        summary: |
            Rugged and serene badlands inhabited by the complex, inscrutable Limns, who bring quarreling mortals here in reverie to forge empathy in the light of a natural phenomenon known as the Consonance, in which you witness in the actions of others a flash of the entire history of happenstance that leads up to their present.

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Empathy Dissolution (NGD)':
        link: true
        name: The Cicatrix
        demonym: Alters
        summary: |
            Floating stony crags and tendrils wind through the endless sky and wind of the Cicatrix, in which the Alters bear the verging currents of catharsis from across the multiverse, celebrating and mourning the passage of things in visceral ritual until the land and their own bodies become more scar than substance. As the airborne land slowly rotates, memorials eventually slip into the sky and are lost.


Synthesis Utility:

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Creation (NNC)':
        link: true
        name: The Asymmetry
        demonym: Grains
        summary: |
            An endless cliff face, with no known ground or top or sides, into which the Grains have quarried for aeons as they craft and sculpt and adjust essential creations for introduction into cardinal worlds.

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Equilibrium (NNP)':
        link: true
        name: The Cartography, The Exhibition, The Testimony
        demonym:
        summary: |
            A lifeless and lethally suffocating expanse that contains every moment of every location in the multiverse, frozen and duplicated here in shades of grey.

    '●◍◍○○○ Synthesis Utility Dissolution (NND)':
        name: The Pasture
        demonym: Mercies
        summary: |
            No petitioners have been found on the blizzarding tundra of the Pasture, only a small nomadic caravan of mortals pursuing a mental state of "unknowing" that they believe will allow their souls to become petitioners here, thereby restoring the lamina's role in the balance of the multiverse, and in persisting through the arctic wasteland of this place they hope to one day find evidence of their success.


Synthesis Power:

    '◍◍○○○○ Synthesis Power Creation (NEC)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Dreams, unfiltered, dangerous, inspiration

    '◍○○○○○ Synthesis Power Equilibrium (NEP)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            the opposite of NGP - opposite of restorative justice? training, pacts of power, helping however but not honorably. Or dangerous beauty, Barbarella society?

    '◍◍◍○○○ Synthesis Power Dissolution (NED)':
        name: The Lucidity
        demonym: Precepts
        summary: |
            Obliterating zen monks aim for ultimate nothingness residing in blank palaces. Flawless control over their attention gives them otherwordly abilities. They occasionally gather outside their realm to perform lengthy ceremonies of "erasure" causing an unepected thing (an artifact, a memory, a person, a river, a civilization) to vanish at the end of the ceremony. Swap with NED? if not need something that pulls them away from pure power. i guess it's about what they choose to remove, some utility to it


Autonomy Empathy:

    '●◍◍○○○ Autonomy Empathy Creation (CGC)':
        name: The Kylix
        demonym: Discarnate
        summary: |
            Ordinary thought is impossible in the baffling avalanche of the Kylix: sensations strike with such speed and force as to crowd out thoughts of a conscious mind, and upon returning from this manic dream no clear memories remain, only a flood of images and a delirium that can last for hours. As a result it is nearly impossible to describe this lamina, and quite dangerous to venture there, but recurring images provide some insight as to its properties.

    '●◍◍○○○ Autonomy Empathy Equilibrium (CGP)':
        link: true
        name: The Brink
        demonym: Apeirons
        summary: |
            Exultant yet mindful hedonists who form a kaleidoscopic community of explorations in creation and destruction, joy and suffering, exertion and renewal. Visitors are welcomed into the fold, and it is impossible not to be overwhelmed.

    '◍○○○○○ Autonomy Empathy Dissolution (CGD)':
        name:
        demonym:
        summary: |
            masochism, death doulas


Autonomy Utility:

    '●◍◍○○○ Autonomy Utility Creation (CNC)':
        name: The Premise
        demonym: Rhemes
        summary: |
            The Premise roils with the bare phlogiston of Creation ꧠ upon which all matter erupts into chaos. Enormous trees rooted in nebulae form islands of stability on which Rhemes intend microcosms into existence out of the raw stuff of this place, enacting free will in a world lacking cause and effect, while the nautilus-shelled city of the Mutatorium invites seekers of self-transformation.

    '●◍◍○○○ Autonomy Utility Equilibrium (CNP)':
        name: The Reverie
        demonym: Eremites
        summary: |
            Endless plain filled with extremely deep, geometric holes, each filled by one soul who remains motionless in apathy and solitude indefinitely. Holes slowly close up on their inhabitants, who don't mind. Extremely peaceful. Rarely, one will climb out and make a pilgrimage.

            OR new alignments: more like some peaceful apathetic limbo for loners? In which case CNP. Their holes are beautifully decorated, some are grassy patches with sun, silence and peace. Sometimes they sleep and the holes close up. Weirdly blank outside each hole.

    '●◍◍◍◍○ Autonomy Utility Dissolution (CND)':
        link: true
        name: The Inevitability
        demonym: Unravellers
        summary: |
            An otherwise-empty wasteland graced by the exuberant and chaotic Procession in which Unravellers joyously manifest the forces of entropy, that universal and implacable slide from order into disorder. Troupes each pursue their own flavors of entropy: rotting food, aging, combustion, romantic miscommunication, broken furniture, political dissolution, and myriad others.


Autonomy Power:

    '●◍◍◍○○ Autonomy Power Creation (CEC)':
        link: true
        name: The Bloom
        demonym: Florets
        summary: |
            A dazzling and hideous jungle in which everything blossoms and transforms and regenerates unpredictably. To its children, the Florets, it is a paradise garden for endless play within the forgiving embrace of their Mother.

    '●◍◍○○○ Autonomy Power Equilibrium (CEP)':
        link: true
        name: The Knot
        demonym: Grips
        summary: |
            Possibly the most dangerous and unintelligible of all laminae, the Knot is a maelstrom of cloud, mud, ocean, rock, and fire through which towering alien behemoths stumble and squirm, striving to devour themselves.

    '◍○○○○○ Autonomy Power Dissolution (CED)':
        name: The Lacuna, The Recital
        demonym:
        summary: |
            Murder as art? Forgetting place?
