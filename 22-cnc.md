summary: The Premise roils with the bare phlogiston of Creation ꧠ, upon contact with which all matter erupts into chaos. Enormous trees rooted in nebulae form islands of stability for Rhemes who intend microcosms into existence out of the raw stuff of this place, enacting free will in a world lacking cause and effect, while the nautilus-shelled city of the Mutatorium invites seekers of self-transformation.

intro: |

    The Premise is a realm for those who in life said "yes" more than they said "no". Here more than any other lamina the curtain of REF[Creation] is worn thin to the point of breaking, making a mockery of logic and comprehension only tamed by the careful intentions of its REF[petitioners], the Rhemes. Great voids of the phlogiston of Creation, that potentiator of all things, fill the Premise, empty to the eye in their purity but hazardous to coherency: any ordinary matter that touches it erupts into lunatic fruition: a flock of birds, a geyser of violet flame, a tangle of seaweed. Some such interactions have cascaded into maelstroms of roiling nonsense---boulders of stone and vegetation, whirlpools of color, entire civilizations' worth of buildings---but islands of relative stability and safety can be found around the massive trees that root in drifting nebulae and in which the Rhemes gather to ponder and intend personal microcosms into existence from out of the raw stuff around them.

    The Premise swells with all possible factors from which anything can be made, an uncontainable plasma that overwhelms the cause and effect of local actions. Where striking a flint to tinder may normally start a small flame, here the tinder is as likely to light ablaze in advance of the flint being struck, or indeed burst into water instead of flame. As with the perversions of REF[CEC] however, the environment does appear to react to the intentions of conscious thought, and is putty to the curious minds of Rhemes. The Rhemes are as eclectic as their environment, sometimes barely recognizable as beings, and have the unpredictable wisdom of children and an unshakeable belief in a concept of "Self Will": that rather than responding to the environment, every being has the agency to cause the environment to respond to them.^[Scholars have contrasted this to REF[LND] (whose facets of REF[Method] and REF[Means] lie directly opposite to the Premise) in which Moilers see themselves as constructs devoid of free will and as beholden to mechanical determinism as the machine that makes up their world.] They are the gods of this place; each creates their own reality, and in their presence this visitor felt like just another of their creations.^[Upon hearing this observation, one Rheme offered a correction: "You are not *in* the Premise, you *are* the Premise."]

    And then there is the Mutatorium. Resembling a nautilus shell the size of a small city, its colors, ridges, and spirals shift as it holds impossibly still against the winds of Creation slamming its sheening surface. Inside, anfractuous passageways house the practicalities of a self-contained society of Rhemes and mortals who receive travellers that arrive (through REF[verges] or otherwise) seeking great change in their lives. Some come to change their minds, some come to change their bodies, some come to change their future, and some bring others---willing or unwilling---for transformation. The Mutatorium's residents are well-meaning assistants in these endeavors, and have created as tools internal chambers in which controlled rivulets of Creation trickle in through ornate portholes from the chaos outside. With sufficient preparation and luck these transformations sometime go according to plan, but many supplicants leave the Mutatorium with something other than what they believed they had intended.

- wow this is nuts?
- mutatorium... something
- probably something about broke cause-and-effect
- you can just go deeper and deeper into the world of each Rheme

### Phlogiston of Creation

### Material Maelstroms

### Anchor Trees

## Culture & Paradigm

### Self Will

### Microcosmic Investigations

## Visiting

### Matter Vesicles

boats/airships where a balloon has wrapped a bunch of miscellaneous matter that gradually is ejected in order to combust with the phlogiston of creation to protect the passengers

## Locations

### The Mutatorium

No payment is expected for the services provided here - the plane itself supplies the raw materials necessary, and the caretakers partake for the joy of it.

What sustains the Mutatorium remains unknown, but the best guess is that the nautilus structure itself is responsible, and that it may be the husk of a dead Lawful Neutral god transported from the Astral Plane and revived into a powerful but dormant, semi-conscious state.

most don't have the precision of intention that the Rhemes do
