summary: The Oval appears to be a complex place, but thanks to the jealous blessings of the TODO(better name?)[Blinking Monarch], it will all seem rather simple once you've left.

intro: |

    Returning from Oval this visitor found that she had recorded the following text in her notes:

    <style>.R-first:first-letter { padding-right: 0em !important; }</style>

    <p style="margin-top: 3em">*The Oval appears to be a complex place, but thanks to the jealous blessings of the TODO(better name?)[Blinking Monarch], it will all seem rather simple once you've left.*</p>

    Unlike REF[CGC], which is unfathomable yet results in a torrent of dreams and images upon return, the Oval leaves travellers with nothing except the vague notion of having interacted with a singular figure, along with a lingering scent of bitter resin. Again in contrast with the Kylix, there have been no reports of explorers failing to return, and so we can assume that either one retains one's conscious faculties while on the Oval (a position bolstered by this visitor's apparent ability to write while there) and is able to exit freely, or that some element inevitably returns visitors safely back through the REF[aperture](apertures) from which they entered. There is unfortunately nothing else to report.

    The moniker "Oval" refers to the fact that all known apertures to this place take the form of tall, elongated ovals---through them can only be seen drifting greys and browns. Some experiments have attempted to ascertain more features of the Oval, employing animals or mirrors or flung articles tied to ropes, but no sufficiently reliable conclusions have been found worth sharing in the present work. TODO(come up with some?)[]

the forgetting place. there is one inhabitant and he wants it all to himself

Maybe they have some rumored and controversial deal/symbiosis with LGC? Like they're good at flawlessly disappearing the handful of people who don't fit in... oh wait LGP. And that sounds like LED should do that?

    - "chaos is the sum of all orders" hakim bey CNC CED
    - “Chaos comes before all principles of order & entropy, it's neither a god nor a maggot, its idiotic desires encompass & define every possible choreography, all meaningless aethers & phlogistons: its masks are crystallizations of its own facelessness, like clouds.” CNC CED

    - Everything is black and white - maybe CED? or NNP, CNP, LED
- possible elements
    - some lingering smell
        - sour, citrus, bitter, pine, vanilla, ash, resin
    - magical research outpost, maybe in CNC or CGC. this is kind of Bloom islet
        + maybe rumored to be in CGC but might be some extra crazy bit of CNC or some other place, hard to know. dissolution one could be on CED
    - Some destructiveness focusing on sloth/inertia - activity is actively punished, but in the laziest way possible. If too proactively punishing, the punishment is punished. maybe CED or LED. wait but inertia is XXP?
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? NEP? eh. see oracle. interesting in CED maybe
    - a city where there is some wild price you have to pay - like having something tattooed on your body (inspired by Palimpsest book) NEC NEP CED
    - Apophatic theology ("attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God") vs. cataphatic theology (the opposite, using positive definitions) XXD CED NED
    - weirdly insensitive and/or literally stupid, but powerful. XXD - NEP, CGD, CED
    - Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, NED, LED, NEP, CED
        - progressively losing senses? end state is vegetative. not very powerful
    - Black hole physics (maybe in CNP or CEP or CED)
    - Lost and found (maybe in CEC or CNC or LNP or CNP or CED) (maybe connected through some weird backdoor to the storage plane?) (i guess CND too, maybe a rumor of a lost objects troupe you can sometimes find stuff in)
        - lost stuff just fades
    - a prison (w research/testing?) (oubliette in CNP, but can be used more elsewhere - LED? LEP? CED?)
