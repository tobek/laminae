## <dfn no-index>General Terms</dfn>

<table class='terms'>
    <tr><td>REF[Apertures](cosmography#apertures)</td><td>Locations where two realms are joined in such a way that you may slip between them. They appear as uncanny distortions through which passage can be disorienting and dangerous.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Cardinal Worlds](cosmography#cardinal)</td><td>The cardinal worlds make up our foundational, everyday reality over which the laminae are layered.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminae](cosmography#laminae)</td><td>Afterworlds that are each aligned with a particular set of facets. The twenty-seven laminae are layered on top of our reality and interact with it in myriad ways.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminals](cosmography#laminals)</td><td>Laminals are beings that natively reside on the laminae but which are not manifestations of mortal souls. 'Laminal' can also be used to indicate anything relating to, stemming from, or residing on the laminae.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Ordial Plane](cosmography#ordial-plane)</td><td>The membrane that divides laminae from cardinal worlds, a membrane which can be forded by various means.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Petitioners](cosmography#petitioners)</td><td>Souls of the dead that have re-manifested on the most well-suited lamina, where they perfect and reshape themselves while carrying out pursuits in accordance with that lamina's principles.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Soblei](cosmography#soblei)</td><td>An ancient city cursed to be frozen in the moment of its apocalypse, Soblei contains thousands of apertures to realms all across the multiverse. Its hurricane winds and blinding light and darkness render it a wildly inhospitable place to pass through even briefly.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Verges](cosmography#verges)</td><td>The thinning of the barrier between cardinal and laminal realities such that certain aspects of one may influence, be perceived, or be simultaneously present on the other.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Ardence](lgd)LGD</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Hierarchy Empathy Dissolution</span></div></td><td>Dark, star-slicked highlands of altars and shrines, each dedicated to a single exceptional petitioner who awaits one final and fatal quest worthy of their heroism.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Asymmetry](nnc)NNC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Utility Creation</span></div></td><td>An endless cliff face, with no known ground or top or sides, into which the Grains have quarried for aeons as they craft and sculpt and adjust essential creations for introduction into cardinal worlds.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Bell](ngc)NGC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Empathy Creation</span></div></td><td>Beautiful, storm-drenched mountains inhabited by the keepers of the "Universal Story", an indescribably transformative experience which they offer to visitors and continually seek to perfect.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Bloom](cec)CEC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Power Creation</span></div></td><td>A dazzling and hideous jungle in which everything blossoms and transforms and regenerates unpredictably. To its children, the Florets, it is a paradise garden for endless play within the forgiving embrace of their Mother.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Braid](ngp)NGP</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Empathy Equilibrium</span></div></td><td>Rugged and serene badlands inhabited by the complex, inscrutable Limns, who bring quarreling mortals here in reverie to forge empathy in the light of a natural phenomenon known as the Echo, in which you witness in the actions of others a flash of the entire history of happenstance that leads up to their present.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Brink](cgp)CGP</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Empathy Equilibrium</span></div></td><td>Exultant yet mindful hedonists who form a kaleidoscopic community of explorations in creation and destruction, joy and suffering, exertion and renewal. Visitors are welcomed into the fold, and it is impossible not to be overwhelmed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Cartography](nnp)NNP</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Utility Equilibrium</span></div></td><td>A lifeless and lethally suffocating expanse that contains every moment of every location in the multiverse, frozen and duplicated here in shades of grey.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Cicatrix](ngd)NGD</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Empathy Dissolution</span></div></td><td>Floating stony crags and tendrils wind through the endless sky and wind of the Cicatrix, in which the Alters bear the verging currents of catharsis from across the multiverse, celebrating and mourning the passage of things in visceral ritual until the land and their own bodies become more scar than substance. As the airborne land slowly rotates, memorials eventually slip into the sky and are lost.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Inevitability](cnd)CND</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Utility Dissolution</span></div></td><td>An otherwise-empty wasteland graced by the exuberant and chaotic Procession in which Unravellers joyously manifest the forces of entropy, that universal and implacable slide from order into disorder. Troupes each pursue their own flavors of entropy: rotting food, aging, combustion, romantic miscommunication, broken furniture, political dissolution, and myriad others.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Instrument](lnd)LND</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Hierarchy Utility Dissolution</span></div></td><td>The labyrinthine interior of a colossal automaton, the outside of which never been seen. The Instrument is tended to by the Moilers, whose culture has lost its knowledge of the automaton's purpose and operation, and as a result have devolved into industrious paranoia and neurosis.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Knot](cep)CEP</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Power Equilibrium</span></div></td><td>Easily among the most dangerous and unintelligible of all laminae, the Knot is a maelstrom of cloud, mud, ocean, rock, and fire through which towering alien behemoths stumble and squirm, striving to devour themselves.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Kylix](cgc)CGC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Empathy Creation</span></div></td><td>Ordinary thought is impossible in the baffling avalanche of the Kylix: sensations strike with such speed and force as to crowd out thoughts of a conscious mind, and upon returning from this manic dream no clear memories remain, only a flood of images and a delirium that can last for hours. As a result it is nearly impossible to describe this lamina, and quite dangerous to venture there, but recurring images provide some insight as to its properties.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Macula](lec)LEC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Hierarchy Power Creation</span></div></td><td>The Macula is a pitch-dark blank realm where every shred of light and substance has long since been utilized by the alien and fractal Oriels to build curling, spectacular palaces in which they warp their minds and bodies in pursuit of ever more esoteric experiences of beauty.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Pasture](nnd)NND</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Synthesis Utility Dissolution</span></div></td><td>No petitioners have been found on the blizzarding tundra of the Pasture, only a small nomadic caravan of mortals pursuing a mental state of "unknowing" that they believe will allow their souls to become petitioners here, thereby restoring the lamina's role in the balance of the multiverse, and in persisting through the arctic wasteland of this place they hope to one day find evidence of their success.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Premise](cnc)CNC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Utility Creation</span></div></td><td>The Premise roils with the bare phlogiston of Creation ê§ , upon contact with which all matter erupts into chaos. Enormous trees rooted in nebulae form islands of stability for Rhemes who intend microcosms into existence out of the raw stuff of this place, enacting free will in a world lacking cause and effect, while the nautilus-shelled city of the Mutatorium invites seekers of self-transformation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Reverie](cnp)CNP</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Autonomy Utility Equilibrium</span></div></td><td>A realm for those who spent their lives saying "no", the Reverie is an endless stone plain in which geometric chasms hold solitary Eremites in rest and contemplation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><div class="tooltip-wrap"><span class="tooltip-anchor">REF[The Unfolding](lnc)LNC</span><span class="glossary-glyph tooltip">Hierarchy Utility Creation</span></div></td><td>Artists and engineers that have architected all of the most famous constructions in existence, original copies of which fill archipelagos that spread across the Glass Ocean, where the enormous automaton wind shifters interlock and glide across empty waters.</td></tr>
