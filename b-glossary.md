## <dfn no-index>General Terms</dfn>

<table>
    <tr><td>REF[Apertures](cosmography#apertures)</td><td>Locations where two realms are joined in such a way that you may easily slip between them. They appear as uncanny distortions through which passage can be disorienting and dangerous.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Cardinal Worlds](cosmography#cardinal)</td><td>The cardinal worlds make up our foundational, everyday reality over which the laminae are layered.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminae](cosmography#laminae)</td><td>Afterworlds that are each aligned with a particular set of facets. The twenty-seven laminae are layered on top of our reality and interact with it in myriad ways.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminals](cosmography#laminals)</td><td>Laminals are beings that natively reside on the laminae but which are not manifestations of mortal souls. 'Laminal' can also be used to indicate something relating to, stemming from, or residing on the laminae.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Ordial Plane](cosmography#ordial-plane)</td><td>The membrane that divides laminae from cardinal worlds, a membrane which can be forded by various means.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Petitioners](cosmography#petitioners)</td><td>Souls of the dead that have re-manifested on the most well-suited lamina, where they perfect and reshape themselves while carrying out pursuits in accordance with that lamina's principles.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Soblei](cosmography#soblei)</td><td>An ancient city cursed to be frozen in the moment of its apocalypse, Soblei contains thousands of apertures to realms all across the multiverse. Its hurricane winds and blinding light and darkness render it a wildly inhospitable place to pass through even briefly.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Verges](cosmography#verges)</td><td>The thinning of the barrier between cardinal and laminal realities such that certain aspects of one may influence, be perceived, or be simultaneously present on the other.</td></tr>

## <dfn no-index>Laminae</dfn>

<table>
    <tr><td>REF[The Ardence](lgd)LGD</td><td>Dark, star-slicked highlands of altars and shrines, each dedicated to a single exceptional petitioner who awaits one final and fatal quest worthy of their heroism.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Asymmetry](nnc)NNC</td><td>An endless cliff face, with no known ground or top or sides, into which the Grains have quarried for aeons as they craft and sculpt and adjust essential creations for introduction into cardinal worlds.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Bell](ngc)NGC</td><td>Beautiful, storm-drenched mountains inhabited by the keepers of the "Universal Story," an indescribably transformative experience which they offer to visitors and continually seek to perfect.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Bloom](cec)CEC</td><td>A dazzling and hideous jungle in which everything blossoms and transforms and regenerates unpredictably. To its children, the Florets, it is a paradise garden for endless play within the forgiving embrace of their Mother.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Braid](ngp)NGP</td><td>Rugged and serene badlands inhabited by the complex, inscrutable Limns, who bring quarreling mortals here in reverie to forge empathy in the light of a natural phenomenon known as the Consonance, in which you witness in the actions of others a flash of the entire history of happenstance that leads up to their present.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Brink](cgp)CGP</td><td>Exultant yet mindful hedonists who form a kaleidoscopic community of explorations in creation and destruction, joy and suffering, exertion and renewal. Visitors are welcomed into the fold, and it is impossible not to be overwhelmed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Cartography](nnp)NNP</td><td>A lifeless and lethally suffocating expanse that contains every moment of every location in the multiverse, frozen and duplicated here in shades of grey.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Inevitability](cnd)CND</td><td>An otherwise-empty wasteland graced by the exuberant and chaotic Procession in which Unravellers joyously manifest the forces of entropy, that universal and implacable slide from order into disorder. Troupes each pursue their own flavors of entropy: rotting food, aging, combustion, romantic miscommunication, broken furniture, political dissolution, and myriad others.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Instrument](lnd)LND</td><td>The labyrinthine interior of a colossal automaton, the outside of which never been seen. The Instrument is tended to by the Moilers, whose culture has lost its knowledge of the automaton's purpose and operation, and as a result have devolved into industrious paranoia and neurosis.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Knot](cep)CEP</td><td>Possibly the most dangerous and unintelligible of all laminae, the Knot is a maelstrom of cloud, mud, ocean, rock, and fire through which towering alien behemoths stumble and squirm, striving to devour themselves.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Macula](lec)LEC</td><td>The Macula is a pitch-dark blank realm where every shred of light and substance has long since been utilized by the alien, fractal Oriels to build curling spectacular palaces in which they warp their minds and bodies in pursuit of ever more esoteric experiences of beauty.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Unfolding](lnc)LNC</td><td>Artists and engineers that have architected all of the most famous constructions in existence, original copies of which fill archipelagos that spread across the Glass Ocean, where the enormous automaton wind shifters interlock and glide across empty waters.</td></tr>
