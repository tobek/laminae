## <dfn no-index>General Terms</dfn>

<table>
    <tr><td>REF[Apertures](cosmography#apertures)</td><td>Locations where two realms are close enough to each other that you may easily slip between them. They appear as uncanny distortions and passage through them can be disorienting and dangerous.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Cardinal Worlds](cosmography#cardinal)</td><td>The cardinal worlds make up our foundational, everyday reality over which the laminae are layered.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminae](cosmography#laminae)</td><td>Afterworlds that are each aligned with a particular set of facets. The twenty-seven laminae are layered on top of our reality and interact with it in myriad ways.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Laminal](cosmography#laminal)</td><td>Relating to, stemming from, or residing on the laminae. Can also be used to refer to creatures that natively reside on the laminae but which are not manifestations of mortal souls.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Ordial Plane](cosmography#ordial-plane)</td><td>The membrane that divides laminae from cardinal worlds, a membrane which can be forded by various means.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Petitioners](cosmography#petitioners)</td><td>Souls of the dead that have re-manifested on the most well-suited lamina, where they perfect and reshape themselves while carrying out pursuits in accordance with that lamina's principles.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[Soblei](cosmography#soblei)</td><td>An ancient city cursed to be frozen in the moment of its apocalypse, Soblei contains thousands of apertures to realms all across the multiverse. Its hurricane winds and blinding light and darkness render it a wildly inhospitable place to pass through even briefly.</td></tr>

## <dfn no-index>Laminae</dfn>

<table>
    <tr><td>REF[The Ardence](lgd)LGD</td><td>Dark, star-slicked highlands of altars and shrines, each dedicated to a single exceptional petitioner who awaits one final and fatal quest worthy of their heroism.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Asymmetry](nnc)NNC</td><td>An endless cliff face, with no known ground or top or sides, into which the Grains have quarried for aeons as they craft and sculpt and adjust essential creations for introduction into cardinal worlds.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Bell](ngc)NGC</td><td>Beautiful, storm-drenched mountains inhabited by the keepers of the "Universal Story," an indescribably transformative experience which they offer to visitors and continually seek to perfect.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Bloom](cec)CEC</td><td>A dazzling and hideous jungle in which everything blossoms and transforms and regenerates unpredictably. To its children, the Florets, it is a paradise garden for endless play within the forgiving embrace of their Mother.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Brink](cgp)CGP</td><td>Exultant yet mindful hedonists who form a kaleidoscopic community of explorations in creation and destruction, joy and suffering, exertion and renewal. Visitors are welcomed into the fold, and it is impossible not to be overwhelmed.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Cartography](nnp)NNP</td><td>A lifeless and lethally suffocating expanse that contains every moment of every location in the multiverse, frozen and duplicated here in shades of grey.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Inevitability](cnd)CND</td><td>An otherwise-empty wasteland graced by the exuberant and chaotic Procession in which Unravellers joyously manifest the forces of entropy, that universal and implacable slide from order into disorder. Troupes each pursue their own flavors of entropy: rotting food, aging, combustion, romantic miscommunication, broken furniture, political dissolution, and myriad others.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Instrument](lnd)LND</td><td>The labyrinthine interior of a colossal automaton, the outside of which never been seen. The Instrument is tended to by the Moilers, whose culture has lost its knowledge of the automaton's purpose and operation, and as a result have devolved into paranoia and neurosis.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Knot](cep)CEP</td><td>Possibly the most dangerous and unintelligible of all laminae, the Knot is a maelstrom of cloud, mud, ocean, rock, and fire through which towering alien behemoths stumble and squirm, striving to devour themselves.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Lucidity](nnd)NND</td><td>A blank, white void graced with marble monasteries in which contemplatives cultivate "lucid body, spacious mind, empty heart." Feared for their ritual of Erasure whereby they cause unpredictable targets to vanish from cardinal worlds.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>REF[The Unfolding](lnc)LNC</td><td>Artists and engineers that have architected all of the most famous constructions in existence, original copies of which fill archipelagos that spread across the Glass Ocean, where the enormous automaton wind shifters interlock and glide across empty waters.</td></tr>
