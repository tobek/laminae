## Lawful Good Preservation LGP

<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun>

what is nature of LGP vs CGP, is it suffering vs none, or suffering vs. "struggle" with no risk of failure.

- suffering vs struggle gives opportunity for hyper-optimized LGP struggle, but CGP might not hyper optimize cause C (although i guess could by evolutionary methods)
- what are other solutions to happiness without suffering?
- maybe CGP has like real pain and risk of failure, violence, gritty. but it's not as absolute a difference
- maybe it's about positive vs. negative reward? although "you lost the competition" which i can imagine in LGP with struggle, is kind of a negative reward.

*The ____*

	They constantly try to escape
	From the darkness outside and within
	By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.

	- T.S. Eliot, "The Rock"

Heaven. The ___ have taken it upon themselves to answer the question "is suffering needed to give context and shape to happiness?" and the answer is predetermined in their undying souls: "no". There is no suffering in ___---there are rules of course, but they are not stifling, and there is joy. The ___ of ___ are a resounding and convincing answer. This is a place where you could drop a demon into the middle of the realm, and the natural order and layout of things would guide him to be an enlightened angel. The academics of ___ study and pore endlessly over TODO to establish a perfect order that does not strive to insulate itself from the multiverse but that strives to create an endless bastion that can weather any change without doing anything except growing and perfecting.

Maybe a loose confederation of small cities, all within same min and max size, and if these ever fall or rise outside of these ranges they must split or consolidate. Cities A/B test themselves, with the most successful (mainly only by immigration and not births; births get re-assigned and raised collectively?) spreading, all aiming for the perfect civilization.

They are really really good at it. no issues with wireheading or "is struggled needed for happiness", the answer is obviously yes, but the struggle need not be suffering, there are hierarchies, there are successes and failures, value systems which petitioners strive to do well by and feel disappointment when they don't or others perceive that they don't, etc. but obviously this is a factor of great experimentation among cities. (or wait, is there some disagreement between LGP and CG...P about whether suffering oh wait at the otp right so either re-work this, or emphasis struggle vs. suffering).

all of this experimentation of millennia has produced amazing civilizations, but there doesn't seem to be an upper limit and they only continue to progress. some hyper-optimized cities have unbelievably intense struggle and competition, cyclic rituals of deprivation and joy

Tokyo?

Does this (and/or other planes) have anything to say about whether humans are fundamentally born good or evil, or blank slate? i say "humans" because in this world presumably some species are innately evil or good. maybe this shouldn't be a d&d fantasy setting...

## Lawful Good Destruction LGD

- Rules/logic for the forgetting thing: if you have visited this plane, then you forget
- bureaucrats ensure missions aren't anywhere where hero will be recognized
- TODO replace hero/champion/etc with demonym
- TODO come up with name (or just stick with) bookkeepers, and find and replace
- maybe different colors (of pavilions and/or champions) based on different spectral emissions/fluorescence of a system of qualities. maybe all the warriors are aesthetically transformed into this?
- One class: thieves who seek out and return stolen goods
- Talk about frozen hero at each pavilion
- if you see the hero: one can be waneella black knight

*The ____*

Most TODO (trimurti outer planes) offer mortals the chance for eternal pursuit and perfection of their philosophical and spiritual ideals as reincarnated petitioners. Not ____. This realm is but a way station on a one-way path to oblivion in the name of honor and benevolence. The champions who find themselves reborn among these dark, star-slicked highlands of altars and mausoleums are instilled with a single purpose: to find one last mission worthy of their abilities, a challenge so perfectly matched that it results in the hero's success and destruction. Pilgrims journey to this plane to appeal to these heroes for aid, and councils of native bookkeepers receive these pleas and assess the odds that it will be appropriately valiant and perilous before sending their champions forth for their final battles.

No songs are sung nor monuments erected to commemorate the deeds of those who pass through this place: all memories of the heroes that leave are erased from the minds of residents and supplicants alike. It is not a land of myth or renown, nor ledgers and historical tomes, only hard work and sacrifice for the greater good. Nothing is commemorated, and the fallen are forgotten.

(some reversal on the prototypical myth of hero who ventures into the underworld - unlike the prototype, these heroes do not return, and are forgotten. it's argued by fans that this is an authentic approach to heroism)

### Environment

The landscape of ____ is otherworldly---hushed and soft and still. The sky is perpetual starry night, brilliant and twinkling, while the terrain is rolling and craggy and covered in rock, moss, heather, and occasional scrub, all in shades of deep gray and black, with occasional muted splashes of somber purple or dull gold. A steady cool breeze causes slight movement. Peaks and the occasional valley or cliffside are crowned by glittering pavilions, each ready to serve as the temporary resting place of a single champion.

Though known generically as pavilions, these structures range in size and style from small altars and follies to sprawling amphitheaters, and they cover the land: from any vantage point you are likely to see at least one pavilion in the distance, and often several. All are made from deep black stone with a subtly colorful iridescent surface and edges that glint in sharp gold. Each calls out to heroes who evince particular preferences: temples and barracks and libraries attracting clerics and warriors and mages, while the size and grandeur tend to match the valor of the champions who wait within them. Innumerable finer distinctions arise: while some pavilions and their champions are more general-purpose, others are dedicated to eternal struggle against ills as varied as necromancy, political tyranny, theft, misinformation, or elemental rampage. In all these cases, structural form echoes motivation and function.

#### TODO/bookkeepers

Native outsiders known as ____ live here. They are a solemn, industrious, but gentle race of tall humanoids with graying flesh and slender, sharp, gaunt faces. They shroud themselves in a dark uniform of hooded, ornate robes, each unique and tumbling with metallic embroidery in complex, methodical patterns.

Each ____ resides at and tends to one of the pavilions. Sometimes they are the sole such resident but often they are one of a dozen or more. They are responsible for receiving visitors and assessing their needs in light of the rules of this place and the capabilities of their current champion, a complex process discussed in the following chapter.

### Culture & Paradigm

Of all the TODO, with the possible exception of TODO, this plane draws perhaps the fewest number of petitioners. Not only must ____s be of extraordinary capability (martial or otherwise), but they must be temperamentally suited to patience, altruism, anonymity, and total self-sacrifice and single-mindedness in the pursuit of their eventual cause.

Like all petitioners, ____s have little to no memory of their mortal life, but in this case their powers and passions burn brighter than before. This is a place where honorable vendettas are done justice. Newly arrived champions explore the landscape looking for a pavilion that suits their stature, capabilities, and passions, discussing expectations with the guardian bookkeepers who may accept them or refer them onwards. At the other end of this journey, each champion eventually departs from their temporary home to carry out their one and final mission, leaving it available for future heroes.

In both accepting a hero and accepting a supplicant's plea for aid, the ____ are strict and thorough in their calculations. Their primary goals are that the hero matches the pavilion's ethos, and that the hero's mission both matches this too, and is uniquely suited to the strengths (and weaknesses) of the hero such that the hero will both succeed and perish. To aid the acceptance of a hero, it appears that these bookkeepers are able to recover information about a petitioner's mortal life, or else in their lengthy discussions can accurately divine the essence of each hero. This acceptance process rarely takes an hour or more.

The plane's ritual of forgetfulness is mediated by the bookkeeper's robes. Once any being dons one of these intricate garments, their memories become wrapped up in the cloth, the symbols growing and warping as the wearer journeys through awareness. Once the robe is destroyed, all of the memories formed during wearing are erased from the wearer's mind. Before a pavilion begins opens to accept a new hero, the bookkeepers each craft a robe for themselves and wear it. Once a hero journeys forth from the pavilion, they weave new robes and burn the old ones in a ritual that lights up the whole pavilion. Thus all their memories of every hero and supplicant that came their way is erased.

#### Supplication

Those who make the pilgrimage to _____ to seek aid are known as supplicants, and must go through a lengthy and TODO/somber process. First the supplicant must seek out an appropriate pavilion housing an appropriate hero. A handful of esoteric libraries and astral hermits have knowledge or maps of the realm that may aid a supplicant, but even with such guidance you may have to search for weeks, intuiting from a pavilion's construction what glory it may house. Bookkeepers at each pavilion, who are able to quickly rule out many requests, will often offer direction to other pavilions near or far which may be more appropriate, or suggest, if necessary, that no pavilion is likely to aid their quest.

Supplicants must come alone, bringing any evidence or material regarding the challenge that they can bring. Once an initial review of a supplicant's crisis has been passed, true deliberations begin. During this process this process the pavilion is sealed from the realm, and the supplicant must place aside all of their belongings and wear one of the bookkeeper's robes while they remain there housed and cared for. Deliberation may last for days or much more, during which bookkeepers conduct extensive research, often traveling to the location of the challenge for further information. Urgent matters are rarely suited for this process, though the process has been expedited in rare cases where the crisis is sufficiently enormous and obviously suited to the hero.

TODO (more about interaction between supplicant and bookos and also what does hero do during this time?)

If a supplicant's request is rejected, their belongings are returned to them and their robe burned. Newly ignorant of the deliberation they went through, the bookkeepers only inform them of the duration of deliberation, and that their request was not suited, and they are sent on their way, either to return in failure or to continue their search.

If a supplicant's request is accepted, the hero is woken. The supplicant and bookkeepers inform the hero of all they know, and a TODO/ritual (describe it) is conducted, in which the robes are burned and the hero sent forth by TODO/teleportation to the appropriate location. The supplicant's belongings are returned, and they are released to return the way they came, knowing only that their request was honored.

#### TODO/term The Hero Beyond (The Hero Utterly, as in how sentences start?)

There are many reasons why bookkeepers work so hard to ensure that a challenge is sufficiently perilous to ensure a fatal victory for their hero. Firstly, any lesser challenge would be a waste of their hero's prowess. TODO/reword Their valiance must be used to the last drop. The second reason is widely feared. A hero that has passed through this realm emerges blinded with vengeful purpose, with all intent boiled and distilled into their quest, and if they do not perish in the process, no consciousness remains: only force and might. These broken raving saviors know only destruction, and wreak it upon anything in their presence. Entire cities have been leveled in the misguided aftermath of such episodes, and the hero will not stop until slain or lost.

The source of this effect is TODO disputed, maybe necessary side effect of channeling all might into purpose, or perhaps place was cursed, is it done on purpose or just the fabric of the plane. Whether the effect is intentional on the part of the bookkeepers or whoever lay the foundation of ____, or whether it is simply infused into the logic this place

This is a place that can tear your life apart and give you the greatest joy you've ever experienced within a span of 24 hours. [dang wasn't i writing about this somewhere? where?] Like LGP, they welcome anyone who wishes to join their society, but there is a matching system and a waiting list in many cases, because you must be guided/mentored. In LGP (like Japan haha) the whole society is structured at every level to lead each resident to perfection (you could be dropped in the middle of the place and everything would work out perfectly), whereas this place is more radical self reliance and go fuck yourself, and many do *not* find their way.

Dionysian and orgiastic, burnt out minds and exultant savants, psychedelic natural disasters tearing and regenerating the landscape.

More than any other plane of Preservation, this preservation is achieved by tumultuous cycles of continual creation and destruction rather, than the gentle balance of stillness.

*The Unfolding*

Landscapes as varied as the multiverse itself cover islands scattered across the endless Glass Ocean, teeming with diverse regiments beckoning imagination into structural reality: towers, bridges, monuments, citadels, silos, domes, parapets, temples, amphitheaters, catacombs, highways, bridges, labyrinths, palaces, prisons, and crenellated parliaments soar and plunge, constructed of wood and stone, metal and bone, crystal and coral and mineral. Across the Unfolding they arc and glisten and groan and grow, and upon the enormous central continent of this realm these structures congregate in a dense symphonic metropolis as far as the eyes can see.

The Architects of The Unfolding are ascendant, peerless artists of engineering and construction. They provide their services freely, for the joy of creation and mastery of their work. Partnering with and training foreign teams visiting from outside the plane, they work together by first devising and building a full-scale version here, before sending their clients home to build the final version in situ.

Their work cannot be purchased: the Architects only take on projects when convinced of their specificity and uniqueness as opportunities to perfect their craft. They are as peculiar and creative as they are diligent and reliable, and are so effective at establishing requirements and marshaling resources and labor that they are able and perfectly happy to work in the service of any power or project, even Chaotic or Destructive, for in their eyes, no agent or perspective has any moral value; they simply reveal the structure of the multiverse, a structure which fascinates them and which they are eager to understand and build upon.

### Environment

The Unfolding is covered by the Glass Ocean, crystal-clear and bottomless, devoid of life or motion. The immense continent of Axial is regarded as the "center" of the plane---inasmuch as an infinite ocean can have a center---in the middle of which is the <index data-key="Scaffold" data-primary="true">Scaffold</index>, a gleaming, skeletal building home to hundreds of offices and guilds and believed to be the tallest structure in the multiverse. The continent is surrounded by archipelagos thinning out to chains of sparse islands.

Each new project is constructed on (or sometimes above or beneath) an island just large enough to support it, incredibly distant from the mainland. Successful and desirable buildings gradually float on their islands towards the center, merging with others and forming larger and larger land masses, some eventually colliding with Axial. Less populated structures may float in the archipelagos instead of merging fully, or may even break off again and drift back out to sea.

Each island is constructed by teams of eccentric Architects known as Patterners, who conjure islands out of the ocean with environments that replicate the desired project site and materials. Since these environments vary wildly, some portions of the mainland contain a surprising patchwork of atmospheric and geographical conditions that influence each other over time, producing unusual backdrops earnestly exploited by Architects for their various competitions and personal works. Inhospitable environments, such as lava fields or tectonic gem caverns, are, where possible, steered towards others of their kind to form smaller uniform land masses.

The Glass Ocean covers the entire realm and lies beneath every surface. This ocean, and the atmosphere above it, have peculiar qualities. The liquid is less buoyant than water (most flotsam sink quickly) and quite cold, but otherwise feels and reacts as water. No waves disturb the surface and nothing lives within it. Significantly, anything left in contact with the liquid, except the land of the realm itself, gradually dissolves into nothing over the course of several hours. This effect extends into the air was well, wherever it is not blocked by land. Objects in the air above the liquid also gradually dissolve, though the effect is slower, taking a day or more.

It is assumed that this dissolution (of unused or recycled materials, daily refuse, lost travelers, and poorly-planned invasions) provides the raw material from which Patterners create new islands. Some connection to the ocean would explain why matter conjured by Patterners, when removed from the plane, quickly disintegrates.

### Culture & Paradigm

No central authority rules the Unfolding: structure is provided by a network of guilds, each with their own specialties and services. For instance, The Shield of Both Eyes retains defense and fortification strategists, The Multitudes creates hermitages and other places of solitude, while The Silver Thread provides translation, diplomacy, and management expertise for dealing with challenging clients and overseeing laborers. Smaller guilds specialize in, for instance, advising on projects situated in a specific environment (such as underwater domains, magma flows, or the Astral Plane), while other guilds are sought out for the styles or materials they employ. Newly arrived petitioners tour guild exhibitions at the base of the Scaffold to determine which best suits their temperament and desires. Guilds are responsible for spearheading projects, and they also perform tasks such as training new petitioners, sending expeditions to other planes for research and inspiration, and organizing symposiums to brainstorm, mingle, and share knowledge with other Architects and visitors.

Architects are famed for irrepressible energy channeled with diligence and purpose. While meticulous, they are far from dull. They are excellent and inquisitive conversationalists, especially on subjects that concern their guild, and are eager to integrate any new information into their encyclopedic repertoire.

A keen, if somewhat literal, sense of humor is also not uncommon. More than once this visitor was excitedly regaled with a story of one design associate who slipped past reviewers a cleverly designed ventilation system: this system would, when the wind was just right, take bird feces bestowed by chance upon a precise spot on the roof of the mountaintop keep of the countess Mayderenne of Fythe, in Cerivalia, and route them to an opening directly above the head of the regnant seated upon her throne. The countess, known as the Lady of Arrows by her subjects, was a proud huntress famed for, of course, her unfailing accuracy at targeting distant birds, and was displeased to be targeted in return.

The associate's guild intended to reprimand her, but was unable to find any declaration in the project contract that specifically excluded such a feature. Furthermore, several superiors had reviewed and signed off on her designs without having noted the unusual ventilation system. The Unfolding lacks a central constitution; law is defined by precedent and by that which is collectively agreed upon by all relevant parties (a system that relies absolutely, and successfully, on the honesty and consistency of its members). The approval of her supervisors indicated that, by definition, the associate had followed the rules, regardless of the client's displeasure with the result. "That is how it is built," an Architect would say of the system that produced this result: there is no judgment to be made, only, perhaps future contracts to update. The associate was found to have committed no wrongdoing, and rose in stature in the guild before eventually parting ways to found the illustrious Quip and Cable, which focuses on intricate, large-scale, cause-and-effect contraptions.

#### Building Services

Visiting parties must make a detailed application for services from the appropriate guild. Once approved, the Architects themselves do not perform manual labor on these projects, but their construction projects follow an exacting protocol. Contracting parties provide their own workforce, who are brought in to and temporarily housed on the island created in the Unfolding as a construction site, in order to perfect the construction locally before returning to build the finished product on their own at the desired site. If clients are unable to execute to the Architects' satisfaction, the project is canceled---a common occurrence.

Although the work involved in building twice is arduous, there are several advantages to the process. Firstly, the Architects wish to have their own copy of the work in perpetuity. Secondly, for both security reasons and the favorable climate and resource availability on The Unfolding, Architects refuse to work outside of their plane^[This visitor has spoken with some Architects who explain this by referring vaguely to a historical event involving an extraplanar dispute that ended in tragedy for the Architects involved. However, this preference may just as likely be a result of their need for---to put it politely---micromanagement.]. Since these projects are far more ambitious and experimental than clients could arrange on their own, a trial run here is the only way they could successfully execute. Both engineers and laborers from the visiting entourage are trained extensively and work closely with planar advisers who are far more skilled and knowledgeable than they are.

As a result of this process, the Unfolding is filled with copies of many of the most famous architectural gems in the multiverse. Once a project is completed, interested petitioners take up residence in it, or a guild may adopt and often modify the structure. The Architects are not hoarders, however, and few structures last indefinitely. When a creation falls into disuse, a celebration is held before the structure is dismantled and its materials returned to the ocean. A scale model is then entered alongside research, blueprints, and adjustment metrics in the alcove-lined corridors beneath the Grand Tensile Pavilion.

#### Private Work

Of course, the most spectacular, creative, and experimental structures in the Unfolding are created in the service of no client, but instead for the pure joy and challenge of it, often for entry into annual competitions in an ever-changing array of categories. Recent competitions include ones for structures with as little contact with the ground as possible, live adjustments to existing structures while Patterners modify the terrain on which they stand, or buildings made from drastically different materials than they appear to be made with. On these internal projects, the Architects do indeed perform the required physical labor. Many are expert artisans in good health, and they often congregate en masse to erect an entire structure in as little as a single day.

#### Wind Shifters

One phenomenon of this realm that is partially beyond the control of the Architects is the wind shifters. It is not clear if these gargantuan entities are living creatures or automatons, though most by far presume the latter. They slowly roam across land and atop the ocean without dissolution. The wind shifters are dozens or even hundreds of meters tall, consisting of countless slender, crystalline rods organized with interlocking joints into complex symmetrical and repeating patterns. The soft breeze that blows across the Unfolding causes them to shift and rotate, moving their parts in an orderly succession that results in their "walking" across the plane. As natural wonders, the wind shifters are treated with a gentle reverence, and their form is a common thread in the visual language of the Architects.

While there is no way to directly control the shifters, the guild of The Eventual Whisper is devoted to analyzing atmospheric conditions and shifter behavior to predict where they will travel with astounding accuracy. This serves two purposes. Firstly, shifters sometimes---though rarely, for most are far out at sea---threaten buildings, and teams known as Chords are dispatched to deploy shields and sails to redirect wind patterns to cause them to alter course. In worst-case scenarios, the Architects find it necessary, with melancholy but no reluctance, to obstruct the path of one of these delicate constructs, thereby causing its collapse.

Secondly, harnesses have been constructed for shifters of suitable shape, under which can be slung large palanquins with sails and rudders, and above which can be fastened tethers to tripod archways that anchor the shifter to roam beneath. The resulting assemblage allows the Architects to use them as vehicles for crossing the otherwise impassible ocean. This is made possible by the fact that the presence of shifters appears to mitigate the atmosphere's dissolving effect, and that they always remain atop the surface of the ocean. They are the only method by which one can safely travel long distances over the waters.

### Guide

#### Visiting

Both the environment and culture of the Unfolding are more hospitable to visitors than many planes. Combined with the fact that the Architects explicitly work with outsiders, this results in a large foreign contingent on the plane. When visiting you must register at an imposing and somewhat bureaucratic office at the base of the Scaffold, and you may then reside temporarily in various taverns and dormitories that will freely cater to your needs. You are welcome to peruse the glories of Axial, but are restricted from viewing any projects under construction, which are anyways safely beyond reach on distant islands. Likewise the laborers arriving with clients for actual construction are quarantined on the island created for their project.

Proposals for projects can be presented at an office at the Scaffold. Those who wish to do so should first review the extensive proposal requirements and consult the guild directory, in order to ascertain the appropriate guild to petition and to seek out relevant Architects for their advice.

Gates to the Unfolding can be found in esteemed engineering and architecture guilds across the multiverse, as well as in the possession of the odd library or patron of the arts. Notably lacking a connection is Soblei; allegedly the ruler of that otherwise famously portal-laden city was so incensed with consequences stemming from a resident's commission that she banned any connection between the two realms.

#### History

##### The Unseen Fray

The Architects are aware that bringing in a large construction force is a potential security hazard. Riskier projects are situated on islands conjured far from important settlements, and the Glass Ocean and its inhospitable atmosphere take care of visitors who go exploring. At the same time, the Architects seem incapable of ascribing malicious intent, and treat the risks, challenges, and occasional failures of their projects as exercises in understanding and working with the nature of beings with agency.

A catastrophe known as the Unseen Fray, in which complex extraplanar rivalries spilled into The Unfolding, is a notable example in the long history of infrequent disasters that have contributed to the strictness of the Architects' process. Some lengthy table-setting is required.

A small but venerable community of eladrin in the Cerivalian mountain range of Mistdance had at the time come under attack from a troupe of balors: demons whose sudden arrival was unexplained. The eladrin were far outnumbered, and over years were forced to abandon their ancient mainland cities and retreat to a volcanic island off the coast, covered in one side with dense forest and the other in volcanic rock graced by occasional rivers of lava. The balors continued to pursue them, and so the eladrin came to the Architects for assistance in building and fortifying their new home in unfamiliar territory, one that did justice to their society's storied past while outfitting the area with defenses that would exploit the coastal and geothermally active terrain.

Patterners dutifully recreated the environment, including the deep chambers of magma that would play a key role in defensive plans, that in The Unfolding hung under the ocean like the bulk of a glacier. Joint work began on melding the eladrin's historical rectilinear, minimalist architectural style with the rugged tangle of coast, mountain, jungle, and underground lava tubes that made up their new home. At the same time, magical and mechanical traps were devised, making extensive and careful use of the generous volcanic activity.

As this project was underway, elsewhere in the plane Architects had been working for decades with a court of yugoloths that had gathered around an unusually social ultroloth who wished to build an industrial empire atop a ruined world that had tumbled into some blasted Outer Plane. They sought the Architects' aid in order to develop technology to mine deep within the TODO(some thing to mine/gather)[untranslatable]. This budding kingdom had been orchestrating various manipulations of pawns in the endless struggle between demons and devils, as yugoloths often did. Unknown to the Architects, one of their schemes included supplying TODO(weapons and supplies)[untranslatable] to the balors who were besieging the eladrin. They had encouraged the balors to build a stronghold on the eladrin's land, since a sealed gate to a vital devil citadel lied beneath the waters between the eladrin's kingdom and their volcanic retreat. Ostensibly the yugoloths promised to help the demonic balors launch a surprise attack upon their foes the devils, but in fact they planned to rip open the gate at a less opportune moment in order to unleash a war between them that, the yugoloths hoped, would cripple both sides. The presence of the eladrin was barely known to them.

The eladrin became aware of this convoluted plan, and also learned of the yugoloths' cooperation with the Architects: that the Architects' work indirectly supported the balors plaguing their society, and furthermore that the leading ultroloth himself frequently visited the plane to oversee progress.

During the Chorus of Sails festival, when many Architects had returned to the mainland, a team of eladrin entered the Unfolding through the gate which connects every project's island to its eventual site, overpowered the Architects present on the island, and somehow learned the location of the yugoloth project. Using the great drills and valves which had been developed to tap into and control underground magma for defensive purposes, the eladrin tore a hole in one edge of the volcano, unleashing a torrent of magma that propelled the entire island towards their target.

The journey took days but was uninterrupted. At the same time, an eladrin prince undertook an ultimately fatal quest to slip into the yugoloth's realm, where he was able, once his brethren had the Unfolding's yugoloth island in sight and signaled across the planes to him, to destroy the portal connecting it to the Unfolding, stranding the ultroloth and many of his senior advisors there.

The material which was being mined by yugoloths on that dead world had been replicated on the Unfolding, and it was volatile and combustible. The volcanic island, in turn, had by that time been converted into an apocalyptic meteor, rigged with magical wards and flinging geysers of ash and magma and pyroclasts. The resulting collision and detonation shook even the distant Scaffold in central Axial, and no yugoloth nor Architect on the island survived.

Two procedural changes were enacted after this incident. Firstly, when accepting a project, scholars now perform due diligence on new clients to ensure there is no active conflict with any other clients currently working on the plane. Secondly, they held a competition to devise a suitable self-destruct mechanism that could be built into new islands, such that any situation that got out of hand could be contained.

This visitor was unable to find whether the gambit, in crippling the eladrin's foes' supply chain, accorded them any respite. A handful of history texts recount the incident, but they focus on the ultroloth's plans and this catastrophe's ramifications on his proxies in other wars. The eladrin are mentioned without any context, as if they undertook the mission out of altruism (a peculiar assumption to make of a race that, while benevolent, are known to be fickle and independent), while it is only in the archives kept by the Architects that the eladrin's side of the story is explained.

The Architects were keen to understand the circumstances: that understanding was an important part of their collective reckoning with what was, for them, a tragedy not only for the loss of Architects and failure of both projects, but also for their inability to comprehend and preempt the situation. The Architects bore no more ill will to the eladrin than one would to the scorpion that stings the foot about to step on it, and only wished to incorporate awareness of their nature into their preparations. Of course the eladrin would use any means necessary to thwart their opponents. "That is how they are built," an Architect would say, adjusting their blueprints accordingly.

#### Locations

##### The Echo Plateau LINK

One consistently recurring architectural contest solicits blueprints for building a monument from struts collected from any wind shifters that collapsed during the previous year. The winner may take one associate with them and spend as much time as required to personally construct their design on the Echo Plateau, an isolated and windswept grassy promontory that is unreachable by wind shifters, so as not to pose them any further collision risk. The contest is held most years, but occasionally a year will pass with no collapses; correspondingly, some years will see the remains of many or unusually large wind shifters, resulting in a very substantial monument. Atop the plateau rest hundreds of monuments, and no other construction is allowed on the land.

Out of respect for the perfection of their original forms, contestants never attempt to incorporate any sort of movement or response to the wind in their creations. What struck this visitor most was the contrast between the inexorable and graceful movements of active wind shifters, and the awful stillness of their constructed echoes on the plateau. This contrast is especially notable given the strong winds across the plain, which would propel active wind shifters vigorously and eloquently.

Shifters are made of a strong, lightweight, opalescent material, affording the opportunity to engineer dynamic and acrobatic structures, though virtually any style may be found among the echoes. In particular there is a divide between artists who choose to complement the geometric exactitude of live shifters, and those who re-interpret their remains in organic or even personified styles. Still others create monuments that resemble shrines, archways, enclosures, optical illusions, plants, and other forms. Most famously, after one year with a record collection of shifter remains, an Architect named Jindarma and his chosen partner (a mortal visitor, a drow supposedly of some renown in his home plane) spent many months erecting a steep, slender, gently curved staircase jutting at an angle off a cliff edge over the Glass Ocean, out and up a hundred meters into the open sky.

The Echo Plateau is a common place of solo pilgrimage for those who have experienced loss, and it is here that a core principle of the Unfolding resonates powerfully: all happenings, irrespective of their emotional or moral content, are opportunities for commemoration, challenge, creation, and beauty.

##### Promenade of Congruities

A slim peninsula forms a long arc off the coast of Axial, and on this strip of land sits the Promenade of Congruities: one long building that follows the land, growing over time, with every section built by different artists. Each new addition extends the original building with a space that simultaneously evokes two contrasting aesthetic properties, one of which is shared with the previous section. Apart from this, the only requirement is that a pedestrian should be able to walk in an uninterrupted path from one end of the promenade to the other.

Reader, The Unfolding is resplendent with masterpieces, but walking the full length of the promenade left this visitor blind with wonder.

A meager summary of the hour's journey will be attempted here.

*Cozy yet Spacious*

The entrance to the promenade is a tall facade the width of the peninsula, built from a rosy warm stone and adorned with pillars and vaulted alcoves. An exterior spiral staircase leads ten meters up to a landing, where an archway passes through the facade to a small balconied corner terrace lush with heavy rugs, darkly patterned bolstered floor cushions, and low tables heaped with lanterns and relics. Silk and gauze canopies flutter from free-standing columns, and ornately carved wooden screens create a maze of niches. The clustered terrace overhangs a vast open courtyard, bounded by white marble walls thirty meters high and angled just slightly outwards. The entire courtyard is completely smooth and empty save for a wide strip of the same rosy stone from the facade running horizontally across the upper part of the walls.

*Spacious yet Cluttered*

Stairs lead down from the terrace, along the wall to the blank enclosure which continues on for a minute's walk, footsteps echoing off the walls. The ground is gradually adorned by small tables, stacked with odd collections of objects. As the courtyard continues, large shelves and cabinets accumulate baubles: pottery and glass dishes, brass lamps, figurines and candlesticks, toys, gems, icons, masks, jewelry boxes, bottles, puppets, daggers, tools, and many objects of unknown purpose, until the wide open enclosure bursts wall to towering wall as an orchard overflowing with treasures underneath the clear sky. A narrow path barely meanders its way through the jumble, though nothing rises above head height and so the path and entire courtyard can be surveyed from every point.

The items are not mere knick knacks. Every last object reveals fantastical detail upon inspection: a tiny animal skull carved into a mosaic lattice and bristling with iridescence, a crystalline globe swirling with colors like an underwater world down to a level of detail too small for the naked eye, an elegant glass bowl holding several stone fruit in a sloped curve as if suspending them in the air, an icon of woven red metallic thread spun into a geometric flower, a miniature bookshelf packed with tiny bound books boasting extraordinary artwork, a finely detailed doll of an eccentric neon-bedecked wizard with a bird draped around his neck, one series of cabinets packed with astonishing porcelain, a chain of wooden beads that each open to reveal allegorical carvings at the most minute scale, and literally thousands upon thousands of other sumptuous miracles.

MEDIA

*Cluttered yet Minimal*

The courtyard ends abruptly outside a square structure of smooth white alabaster into which cuts a square entryway. In the large enclosure inside, thousands of featureless alabaster cubes from as small as a fist to as large as a boulder affix to the floor, walls, ceiling, and each other. They pile irregularly, sometimes stacking towards the vertical middle of the room like stalagmites and stalactites, leaving no path through except to clamber over and around their rectilinear precipices and crevasses.

Each cube presents a slight indentation on one edge, with which that face can be slid aside to reveal an interior overflowing with more artifacts. As varied as those in the courtyard outside, these however are every last one pure white, of the same material as the building and its cubes, without any variation in shade or texture. From this visitor's brief exploration, the cubes appear to be organized in ways both obvious and obscure. One contained pieces carved into shapes of branches and leaves, while another was full of reliefs showing the portion of the face containing one eye and the small area of brow and cheekbone around it. One especially large cube gathered life-size sculptures that included a hand attached to an arm, a small birch tree, a flower, a scimitar, a spoon, a chess piece, a tied-back curtain, a pipe, and several animal horns, all collected under perhaps no more articulate an organizing principle than the aesthetic of slenderness.

MEDIA("Stéphane Malka - Rue Sans Frontieres 2.jpg")

*Minimal yet Oppressive*

A small square cut-out in one corner, through which one must duck, exits into another sparse, smooth, white room. The space is dimly lit by the sky visible through a series of small, square openings in the ceiling over which a constant wind whips, creating a loud, toneless, hum that also causes the room and everything within it to steadily vibrate. The ceiling itself slopes evenly downwards as one progresses along a narrow path along the right wall, cut out from the chest-height platform that fills the rest of the space. to the left

It is tempting to hurry through this unpleasant place, but lingering as one's eyes adjust to the monochrome and dim light reveals astonishingly complex geometric patterns detailed on every surface in the faintest pale gray, barely contrasting with the white stone MEDIA("Johnny Abrahams"). The patterns themselves are dizzying and difficult to observe, appearing to shift under a moving gaze. Once sighted, these patterns are visible in every direction, yet closing one's eyes only leads to more keenly sensing the room's hum and vibration.

Towards the exit the ceiling lowers to a height too low to stand freely.

*Oppressive yet Peaceful*

At about one and a half meters high, the ceiling ceases descending, and the raised platform that fills the whole chamber to the left of the narrow path opens into a placid body of water, held back from the path at the same height by a low wall. Fewer openings in the sky decrease the intensity of the wind's hum and vibration, and the further dimmed light makes the vertiginous patterns less perceptible. The already-narrow path is reduced by a seating platform running along the right wall, leaving a space too thin to either stand or sit comfortably. One can sit uncomfortably, however, angling the legs to find foot room without treading into the water, obliquely observing the vast, glassy pool. From this lower elevation, the whistling hum of the wind shifts to a just slightly more tolerable tone.

*Peaceful yet Cursed*

The path leads up a few steps to level with the pool and through a narrow opening mercifully into a gleaming, bright, outdoor space, once again contained by towering walls sloping outwards, one the same marbled white, the other a sleek black. The water continues, at an angle alongside a checkered black and white plaza, and ending at a crumbling grotto of igneous black rock that rises incongruously from the tiled ground. The water ripples just barely at the edge of the rock. From the overhang of the grotto waves a series of black wind chimes that issue gentle, clodding, flat noises in the breeze.

Two large statues of horses stand knee-deep in the water, one black, one white, each with a flourishing of dozens of smooth globes in the place of a head MEDIA("andrea galvani"). The acoustics of the space are such that sounds seem to echo louder and longer than they should, in a strange interval that accelerates before fading. Footsteps on the crisp tiles produce a startling noise, leading one to walk gingerly. By the edge of the water a passage leads darkly through the rock.

*Cursed yet Hallowed*

The short passage opens up to an immaculate shrine of sleek black. Light trickles down from white frosted windows behind wrought metal skirting the dome that tops the space, and four archways along the perimeter each lead down four steps to a blank wall. In the place of one of these walls is a small window hushed closed with heavy red curtains. A smell like burnt honey hangs with the sunbeams.

Around a central dais ring a congregation of smooth black statues, each a distinct humanoid character but all with pieces missing or forgotten: part of the torso, a hand, an eye, a cheek. Resting on the dais is a small, elongated, hoofed animal in a fetal position, eyes closed, its skin hairless and strangely unwrinkled, faintly revealing some texture beneath. It is unclear whether the motionless creature is delicately, perfectly, softly carved from some milky stone, or if it is something else entirely, and this visitor could not bring herself to step into the circle to find out. MEDIA("tim flach") MEDIA(maybe "d67001c24d013e8f36bfac0562d7480c" or that chelsea sculptor)

An additional feature decorates this space. Initially one might notice a dab of black streaking across the white floor, then again from another direction, then none for some time. A close inspection finds minuscule holes dotting the creaseless floor. Occasionally, a single drop of black liquid will issue forth and trickle along the floor, a perfect ball of surface tension, until it slips down another hole, at times first merging with one or more other drops to form a streak significant enough to catch the eye from standing. Each drop roams an uncertain path, perhaps by some agency, or somehow by gravity on the unsloped floor, or by some other means. MEDIA(teshima art museum)

The room initially presents no exit, and some have apparently turned to backtrack from here. This visitor, however, had traded her hesitance before the central statuette for a sudden curiosity to see outside the velveted window, and found there behind it a small egress through which to climb.

The window opens to the rear altar of a tremendous vaulted cathedral of which the front nave and entrance some hundred meters away is completely shorn off in a burst of crumbled dark gray stone. Daylight streams quietly in from the open space beyond, as it does through the cracked ceiling and fractured remnants of stained glass windows, the bulk of which lies prismatically glittered and ground into the broken tiles and exposed dirt beneath. Shattered pews lie softening in orderly rows alongside pieces of statues, and entire surfaces are pleasant with lichen, scrambling vines, and fungus luminescing in dim corners.

Great streaks of white are painted upon every wall, sweeping and overlapping in concentric ellipticals that cluster complexly nearer the ground but recede to vague gestures towards the cathedral heights. The patterns are both orderly and chaotic; although absent of repetitions or symmetries, the strokes appear elusively coordinated and self-similar.

A fine layer of dust covers the whole space: a combination of dirt, crumbled stone and stained glass, and disintegrating plant matter. Walking and the occasional breeze stir up gentle clouds that coat the walker and drift into sunbeams. Scattered about rest many copies of the same book, a large tome with a deep purple binding edged in metal, whose pages are universally smudged, torn, water stained, and moldy beyond legibility. Each has been carefully placed, whether atop fragmentary piles, in small clearings between the debris, or nestled on beds of lichen-covered rubble.

At the end of the structure, the ground itself crumbles away until only a narrow path of stone leads across a distant pit littered with rubble, walled by the same sloping white from earlier courtyards. The path ends in a wall that holds a narrow door of smoky glass running up its whole height.

*Sullied yet Luminous*

The towering door opens to a dim chamber in which the same narrow stone path leads across a deep chasm walled by scratched and frosted glass lit a pale violet. The blurry surface makes it impossible to ascertain the walls' distance as they recede downwards into darkness. From the ceiling hangs at varying heights just out of reach a dense forest of glowing objects, a wild and motley jumble filling the space above except for a narrow empty channel over the bridge itself.

There are hundreds of lamps and chandeliers, all stained and cracked open, but most still lit by candles and oil wicks. Luminescent flowers and fungi and fruit and feathers grasp and dangle, drooping from small metal frames; gems and statuettes slowly twirl, chipped and marred, gleaming internally. Mirrors and mirrored and metallic objects---platters and goblets, weapons tools coins crowns and candelabras, tarnished and twisted---each catch and fling a legion of glimmers.

The swaying aerial kaleidoscope makes it difficult to focus on the slender pathway, and shattered remnants smolder and twinkle dizzyingly at the edge of sight upon the ground far below. Dull clinks sound, most alone in the silence, but some unpredictably in clusters and cascades.

At the end of the pathway a narrow opening cuts through the height of the space, and stark white light bolts from the hallway beyond.

*Luminous yet Dark*

This section consists solely of a precipitously tall and winding hallway, studded with narrow alcoves ending in featureless, blindingly bright windows that fail to illuminate the pitch-dark and matte material out of which every surface is built, a material which collapses the distinction between wall and empty space, leaving a maze of evasive obtuse and acute corners. There is nowhere one can stand such that anything can be properly seen at all: from all angles intervenes a slender blazing light too large to shield the eyes from, constricting the vision such that nothing can be discerned along the dark hallway which, as a cruel joke, is irregularly interrupted by sudden turns and one or a handful of steps up or down. Perhaps other features lurk in the brilliant shadows, awaiting appreciation by those with especially limber pupils.

*Dark yet Fiery*

The lights dim as the hallway progresses, eventually taking on a warmer tone and growing hot, until the narrow path gives way to a soaring cleft abutting a dark open space. A maze of low piles of smoldering embers forms a vast, circular walking labyrinth. The room is ablaze with the heat of the embers, but their light is too dim to illuminate either any walls or ceiling or even your own body: everything is suspended in blackness. This visitor walked nearly to the point of losing sight of the maze without reaching side walls, even back to the entrance, tracing the dark anterior wall until, after bordering the previous chamber, it turned away from the labyrinth to continue receding.

If you choose not to skirt around it, the labyrinth is both welcoming and challenging. One the one hand, though it wends elaborately towards the center and then out again, it is unicursal, with no branching paths, and the embers burn cleanly, releasing little ash or smoke. On the other hand, the heat is extraordinary, lending an urgency to your passage, and if stepping over the cinders to take a shortcut a visitor should beware the ignition of an errant scrap of clothing. The whole passage, all circular curves and right angles, takes maybe half an hour to traverse and has a peculiar effect on the vision, filled as it is for so long with the darkness and peripheral dance of red streaks in a haze of calidity. This visitor had the powerful sense while walking that she was in fact unmoving, as the great, wavering, manifold disc translated and rotated around her body.

TODO(something in the center of the labyrinth, maybe embers too high to cross surrounding something people have thrown things in to sacrifice, or maybe some scaffold-like catcher thing?)[This paragraph is too smudged with soot to be legible. It seems to describe a thing at the center of the labyrinth, and perhaps something about pilgrimage or sacrifice.]

<!--
Dark: shadow, can't make out things, fading, things being lost, hiding
Fiery: burning, ash, things being consumed, inability to approach, heat

-->

There is no indication of the chamber's egress except to walk straight from the labyrinth's exit, carefully, until reaching a black wall, following it left or right to adjust for an imprecise gait, until an opening reveals itself. A narrow black hallway turns back and forth upon itself as it progresses towards more light.

*Fiery yet Wet*

The hallway leads to a large square chamber bathed by a rippling pinkish glow. The chamber is a pocket of air surrounded by liquid: the ceiling and walls are formed from a transparent material holding back great depths of water. The room itself is submerged to chest height in water into which the path descends. Rising just above water's surface stands a grid of sixteen thick pillars of veined marble, each topped by a stupendous bonfire releasing heavy plumes of smoke. Fortunately, the smoke rises straight through circular holes cut out of the watery ceiling above each pillar, a shaft of ashen air encircled by water and leading to open blue sky, leaving your lungs free as you wade through the hot air and cool water, though a potent smell still hangs in the air, of perhaps cedar tinged with unknown spices.

Above one pillared bonfire at the edge of the room, a leak in the ceiling, or perhaps a careful hole, fires a small jet of water onto the flames. Undeterred, the bonfire proceeds apace with hissing and crackling spits of steam and sparks.

After the warmth of the previous room the water is refreshing, but your face remains subject to the prickling heat of the bonfires until steps rise out at the other end of the chamber.

*Wet yet Arid*

<!--
Wet: soaked, cold, dissolving, refreshing, life-giving, humid, slippery,

A threshold cuts through the water tank wall, opening into another chamber covered by a continuation of the glass ceiling but empty of water and instead open to the sky. On either side return the outwardly angled white stone walls from earlier in the promenade. The ground here is a smooth but uneven, a dark gray rock, lumpily descending at a gradual slope. Along the bottom edge of the watery wall of the previous space a slight but steady sheet of water slicks onto the rock and down the slope.

This room is blisteringly hot: the transparent ceiling welcomes and then traps the heat of the day, while the wet sheen of the ground gathers in no crevice or pool to provide respite.

Suspended just off the ground in the center of the otherwise empty room is what appears to be a large streak of vivid orange liquid, twice the height of a person, hanging amorphously like a geyser paused mid leap. The undulating surface is smooth and of a color varying with thickness, thinning to translucency at some parts and separating into sprays of thick dangling gobs at others. To this visitor's touch it felt unyielding and wet, yet left no moisture on the skin.

*Arid yet Verdant*

<!--
Arid: barren, not supporting life, thirst, dry, dispirited, bare, blank

-->

The slope eventually levels out, and what little water that reaches this far in liquid form drips out of sight into a thin crevice running from one side of the room to the other. The glass ceiling continues and this room is as hot as the last.

A terraced, pillared, white stone ziggurat fills the chamber, rectangular but bordered by star-shaped turrets, bursting from all corners with cacti and succulents and dry fungi, almost entirely in hues of washed-out green dotted scarcely with patches of color: blood red spines, tiny indigo flowers, blue-gray mottled veins, silvery scales. No two plants are alike. They line staircases and overflow from enormous urns and beds filled with white sand; they hang from parapets and sprout horizontally from terrace walls and vertically from beveled overhangs.

The edifice itself is sculpted on all surfaces with low reliefs depicting rituals and gatherings of all kinds: funerals, banquets, processions, harvests, weddings, and scenes that this visitor could not decipher. From the top of the structure tower a series of the most gargantuan sort of aloe, pressing up against the glass ceiling and then draping over the entire space, their smooth gray-green tendrils thicker than tree trunks.

*Verdant yet Lifeless*

<!--
Verdant: flourishing, lush, fresh
Lifeless: barren, inert, empty, inanimate, sterile, waste, dull, passive, lackluster
-->

The building continues as the chamber does, but the plants become gradually more wilted, withered, and pale. Deep cracks vein the structure's carvings and sculptural crumbles litter the floor; dust begins to fill the air and rest on the overflowing and faded flora. No flower or fruit decorate here, and everything has sunk to the same whitish color. The colossal aloe trees that line the topmost tier become sallow like the rest, their massive limbs hollowed out and concave with brittling flesh. White sand overflows and accumulates in heaps. Yet every surface is still packed with vegetation. It is unclear on which side of the cusp of lifelessness they remain.

The higher terraces give way to a long, elevated pool that releases a caustic, pungent, overwhelming odor, stinging the nose and lungs. The roots and stalks of crowded vegetation are absolutely white where they dip into the fluid, and at its bottom a painting depicting in sharp detail an orderly and colorful garden lies visible through the still and clear liquid.

*Lifeless yet Colorful*

<!--
Lifeless: muted, clouded, barren, inert, empty, inanimate, sterile, waste, dull, passive, lackluster

The pool ends in a narrow ledge after which another begins, this one filled with thick, marbled swirls of liquid color. Flora whose roots dip into this pool, and indeed everything in this transformed section of the ziggurat, are plump and vibrant. Broad leaves covered in gaudy dots, stripes, and unusual patterns sprout from trunks and branches that sport glittering whorls, while dangling tendrils of wholly unnatural colors wave stiffly from terraced edges. The plants all respond to the touch with the same odd rigidity.

The building itself continues in identical structure but painted bright colors, and between carvings of gallivanting animals and feasts hang circular windows, some as small as a head and others larger than a person. Each reveals a vivid diorama behind the glass, from miniature to life-size: a stable of fantastical creatures, a library overgrown by trees MEDIA(lori nix - Apocalyptic Miniatures - library.jpg), a bakery resplendent with ornate confections, a noble receiving an audience in a golden yellow throne room MEDIA(Andrei Ryabushkin - 1893 - Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich with the Boyars in his Throne Room.jpg), a huge display of iridescent glassware, a tank of wildly ornamented stationary sea creatures, and myriad interior palatial scenes. Upon the floor of the life-size bakery diorama lies a complete skeleton draped in tattered cloth, alarmingly incongruous with the tidy and coherent productions in every other display, but this visitor could not find a way in to any of the rooms.

The sloping marble-walled chamber continues to contain the bizarre structure, which finally and abruptly ends with a thin elevated pathway that stretches out to a translucent, iridescent barrier that extends across the whole chamber. The glassy barrier glints with a crackled texture: purplish and teal and red depending on the angle of sight to its surface. Where the pathway strikes the wall stands a door, barely delineated by a slim gap, which opens with a gentle push to the next section.

*Colorful yet Clear*

<!--
Colorful: brilliant, vibrant, rich, splashy, gaudy, kaleidoscopic, loud, lively

The first thing one sees is the immense expanse of the Glass Ocean and sky: the far side of this chamber is open to the outside world. The Promenade til this point obscures the exterior landscape totally, and easily makes one forget what lies beyond its walls, but in this space the Unfolding comes rushing back in. The walls, ceiling, and floor are glass, revealing beneath and beyond them the grassy dunes and rocky coastline of the peninsula which supported all the previous spaces.

A broad path passes through the middle to the unadorned ledge where the Promenade ends, but a series of translucent internal glass walls maze symmetrically around the rest of the chamber, each wall tinted its own single color such that every line of sight---except the clear path ahead---passes through multiple walls and displays the world in overlapping hues. A variable breeze wends through these pathways, delivering the sharp, clean, unplaceable scent of the Glass Ocean from unexpected angles.

Three large kaleidoscopic "windows" (for they are not really windows, as they obscure the view more than the surrounding glass) unfold on each side wall: dense, chromatic, multifaceted blossoms of gem and crystal that warp and wrap the sights beyond.

To one side in the open central path is a large, eight-sided pillar covered in colorfully mirrored, angled planes. Each side reflects the viewer in a unique way---fractured and disjointed in one, as a stained glass mosaic in another, and on one side reflected by a plain mirror revealing the multicolored shadows cast on the viewer by the surrounding walls.

The very edge is bare, awaiting the structural segue yet-to-be-planned by whichever Architect creates the next section. A slender crystalline ladder descends from this edge to a footpath below, which leads back inland.

***

It is not clear where to go next. The obvious antonym to "clear" is "opaque", but the combination is challenging. "Dark" would possibly work, but has been used in the Promenade already. Either combination draws cheerful gags about a chamber that blinds its visitors. Perhaps "mirrored"? Or else more sections added on to the beginning? Ideas will surely come.

This visitor met one excited Architect, preparing a proposal for the Promenade, who had just returned from an expedition to LINK The Wilt for the advice of two legendarily astute and immortally bickering ____[Blighted] lovers, asking after what could be both both clear and opaque, and receiving the answer "information".

##### Abandoned Archipelagos

While in theory every disused or undesired construction is disassembled and reclaimed, in practice some face other fates for a variety of reasons, from the inhospitableness of its terrain or unusually difficult materials used, to simply gaps in bureaucracy. This visitor heard a few mentions of a sizable continent consisting of all the works of a particular disgraced Architect pushed far out at sea, but further details varied: a lingering plague, violent extraplanar squatters, a demigod's curse.

#### Rumors

##### The Kindling and Wind Shifter sentience

After an untold number of failed attempts to communicate with or elicit reaction from wind shifters, it has been assumed that they are inanimate natural constructions. This position is bolstered by the esteemed mathematician Galabast, who was able to replicate their behavior purely from physical principles and produce a mechanical model that functioned on a smaller scale, albeit much more weakly.

Wind shifters function immaculately when undisturbed, but are otherwise precarious. Travel palanquins are carefully fitted to individual shifters so as not to damage them, but miscalculations or even minor brushes with artificial structures generally cause a shifter to buckle and collapse. Once the delicate arrangement of joints is perturbed, the shifter ceases to function entirely (a trait also replicated by Galabast's models) and its parts are used as materials for monuments on the Echo Plateau LINK.

However, some devotees insist that they are sentient, an opinion which relies on an unusual event seen by many but with differing interpretations.

During one year's Glintings LINK, two shifters were passing through a densely built-up area, one shifter unusually lanky and about 100 meters tall, and the other smaller but densely intricate. The taller one had already surpassed the previous record for unaided, collision-free journey length across Axial, and forecasters continued to predict no collisions, but had Chord teams at the ready. When the two shifters were about a mile from each other, however, the larger one altered its path by about 1 degree, an enormous deviation from forecaster predictions, one which put it on a collision course with the other shifter less than a stone's throw from a plaza in front of the Scaffold in which a Glinting fair held hundreds of apprentices' scale models.

In the ten hours of debate and calculation between this shift and the predicted collision, Architects considered whether to intervene or let the Unfolding take its course. The final decision was intervention, but the malfunction of a large sail delayed the effort, and the two shifters collided. In front of thousands of onlookers, all of whom expected a dumb crumpling, the two colliding entities intricately threaded into each other and slowly twirled and merged in place for minutes. At the completion of this serene dance, the two shifters passed through each other on their original courses, while a third shifter emerged traveling in a different direction. The readied Chords, having repaired their tools, had to immediately act to divert this "child" away from the the packed plaza which had in previous calculations been deemed outside the range of possible paths by a wide margin. They were successful, and an annual festival, The Chorus of Sails, was later established to celebrate the Chords' astonishing feat of intuition, teamwork, and athleticism, performed as it was without forecaster calculations and no advance planning, amidst dozens of buildings and thousands of dispersing bystanders.

The incident itself, dubbed "The Kindling", remains the only verifiable instance of wind shifter collision. Accounts and interpretations of the event vary. Materialists (those who doubt wind shifter sentience) assert that it simply indicates that shifter complexity had been underestimated. Sentimentalists (who style themselves Realists) argue that there is no accounting for the relatively drastic change in course made by the one shifter, for which random chance is a poor explanation, especially when no atmospheric changes were detected and it set the shifters on a perfect collision course. Additionally, Galabast and his studio have so far been unable to reproduce anything other than total collapse in wind shifter model collisions.

A second disagreement concerns the relative size of the shifters. Precise measurements of the size of the two "parents" had not been taken beforehand. Many onlookers asserted that the two parents emerged smaller, such that the total size of the three shifters was equal to the initial size of the two. Yet other onlookers swore that the two parents remained unchanged in size, indicating that some force or material must remain out of sight within a shifter to afford for a child to be created, further suggesting that there is more to wind shifters than their outward physical form.

The Eventual Whisper guild dispatched a group to follow the child shifter to see if any more unusual events followed. It roamed uneventfully, except that it stayed on dry land for an uncommon length of time. After several months, it headed out to sea. Since its structure would not support a transport palanquin, and no other shifter was heading in a similar enough direction to direct it to follow, the observation was abandoned once the child passed onto the inhospitable waters.

A small group, mostly extraplanars, and deemed fanatics by others, are convinced of the sentience and agency of shifters, and regard The Kindling as a nigh holy event. They have formed a base on a remote island on which to develop techniques that might withstand the dissolving effect of the Unfolding, so that they could freely explore far out into the Glass Ocean, presumed to be the native environment of the shifters and where they are more plentiful, in order to better study them.

A malicious rumor, given little consideration, posits that this devoted band of Sentimentalists are influenced by a destructive ideology anathema to the plane's civilization: that the petitioners drawn here as Architects, and the land that they shape, are colonizing intruders who should be destroyed or exiled in order to return the Unfolding to a presumed virgin state: one of uninterrupted glassy waters, endlessly traversed by sentient yet unknowable wind shifters.

## Lawful Neutral Preservation LNP

Archivists.

Everything is collected (in some unusual architectural shape, maybe captured in some preserving gel that floats and is connected to some crystalline structures).

They're "essentialists": trying to define the essences of any given object, but not into elements like fire or wind or even emotions or tendencies like excitement or neuroticism, but into very specific categories like "tending to ______" OR WAIT could be like counter words in japanese.

People come here to discover and define themselves like meyers briggs or astrology haha.

Similar to the Mathematicians of Mechanus:

> A sect splintered from the Guvners, the Mathematicians hold that everything that you can imagine can be found on Mechanus in some form, and by cataloguing this and applying logic, symbolism and math to this one can unlock the secrets of the plane. They don't do this for riches or power: they are a group of serious minds who want to discover the secrets of the plane for scholastic reasons. While they still have a long way to go their stay on Mechanus has impaired the Mathematicians with a superior understanding of the Labyrinthine Portal, the network of portals on Mechanus that links every single cog with another one. With this understanding the members of this sect can calculate in record time in which order you have to go through the portals in order to get to where you want to go. Lawful people of superior intelligence are welcome to join them, but it is expected of members to not share their findings with non-members.

### storage

All or part of this plane is based around temporary and free, but regulated and often indefinite, storage.

people come from all over the multiverse to store stuff there, and they are REALLY GOOD at storage. they can store anything of any size, with any magical qualities or dangers or challenges. some fastidious dragons clear their treasure pits and store them for safekeeping, some store vanquished foes, cursed magical heirlooms, exotic pets, botched experiments, anything.

there are conditions to storage. maybe it has to be something they don't currently have? and if that's the case, they will store it for free, in flawless condition, taking care of it if necessary. part of the condition though maybe is that they have to be allowed to study it? can they touch it? they've never been known to mess anything up though. is there anything they won't store?

## Lawful Neutral Destruction LND

"Smoothers". OCD to its most insane extreme. Different factions OCD about different things, and cities built around these things, e.g. the Bleachers clean things to the bone/disintegration, or sanding/smoothing until nothing remains, or analysis until meaninglessness, or repetition until nonsense

This is a land of compulsion, ritual, and order.

Life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. The imbalance always remains. Live cannot proceed as normal.

Cleanliness, orderliness, hoarding, skin/hair/nail biting, checking things, tics, flaws in clothing.

Maybe they're the opposite: they introduce these imbalances, very carefully and orderly-ly? Split down the middle for those who introduce and those who clear?

Linked but oppositional to CNP? Or rather aligned on some processes but disagree on others? Or they worship CNP as gods, whose ways are mysterious to them?

# **True Neutral**

## True Neutral Creation NNC

Sculptors? Some believe the gods themselves---some of them, all of them, who knows?---were painstakingly sculpted in these forges. They'll make anything but keep careful ledger so that the output of the plane remains balanced. Every thing created is forecast to have certain effects, and miscalculations are rapidly accounted for. They are famous employers (famously rewarding, famously exacting) of explorers and researchers who report back to them on the results of their more ambitious or uncertain endeavors. It's said that these mercenaries are chosen very, very carefully. Often the act of investigation itself and those chosen to investigate are meant to fix any imbalances, and surprisingly often the investigators themselves find their own nature changed in the process.

## True Neutral Preservation NNP

- objects shoved outside of plane become completely normal, though this is rarely achieved. There are records of retrieval of a feather, some captured steam, and a few blades of grass.

*The ____* (dissimulation: precepts of lucidity)

This is possibly the most uncanny of realms, for it contains copies of the entire multiverse, including itself, shorn of the concept of time and encumbered by implacable hazards. Somewhere within this realm every separate instant of the entire multiverse is replicated at full scale, animate and inanimate laid out in complete detail with all the lifelessness of a chess set. Should you chance a visit must, you must take extraordinary precautions to even survive.

You may find here the scene of your own birth, any fraction of an instant of it, and from that moment explore outwards through your world, encountering it as it was frozen at that point in time. Or you may find the scene of your death (as this visitor was incomprehensibly lucky enough to witness) or perhaps the lair of your enemy, the workshop of a future inventor, a key scene in your past or future with infinite leisure to explore and learn. But, infinitely more likely, your visits to this plane will land you in only the most random and irrelevant of slices of space and time.

Although the overworked and over-inspired dream of the ability to stop time, and occasional wizards attain this control, the passage of time is so deeply rooted in the experiences of sentient things that a world without time feels broken; the cold silence of things that should be breathing is unnerving. And despite a superficial appearance of normality, it is deathly dangerous here. Light, sound, warmth, and even breath do not follow their normal patterns, and many visitors lose their grasp and remain forever as frozen additions to the display.

### Environment

The ____ is unfathomably vast, and navigating it is both very straightforward and quite impossible. From within a given replica of a moment in time and space, known as a tableau, you may explore the geography of the world as normal: everything is laid out at one-to-one scale. But there is no obvious way to remain in the same location and move forwards or backwards in time, nor does there seem to be any way to move to a drastically different location (say, a different plane) while remaining at the same moment in time. Portals from outside the plane connect to a range of tableau of course, and methods are known to attempt travel to a desired tableau, with terrible risk and unpredictability. Most journeys here lead to tableau that unrelated or useless except for curiosity or perhaps meditation, and most often of all you will arrive in what appears to be an infinite primordial darkness.

It is not a pleasant place to loiter. The first thing you will notice is that this realm is devastatingly cold. Unprotected, you will succumb in minutes from a cold shock worse than being plunged into an icy lake: rapid breathing, panic, muscle incapacitation, and failure of the heart. Touching an object with bare skin will result immediate and severe frostbite. Encumbrous physical protection will work for a time, but magical warmth is typically needed.

Beyond the cold there are several other unusual properties here. There is no sound possible at all except for the faintest of mufflings audible with your ear pressed against something. Even shouting in another's ear only generates a drawn-out murmur. Scents, too, are faint, and frozen in the air: you may just barely smell the smoke of a newly lit fire when next to the fire itself, but it will not travel far, unless the fire was lit sufficiently long ago that the smell would have already traveled that distance.

More unsettlingly, the movement of light itself slows to a crawl. When holding your arm out, there is about a second's delay before your eyes detect any movements your hand makes, but of course the parts of your arm closer to you appear to move more quickly, so the result of sweeping your arm to the side is a distorted gradual motion from your shoulder outwards. Of course, since nothing in the environment moves this only mildly disorienting when alone, but in the presence of other visitors, this effect combines with the absence of sound to sculpt a claustrophobic experience where you can never trust your senses.

The full effect of this deserves to be laid out in detail. Light appears to travel at about 1 yard every second, which the average person can easily outrun. Imagine someone stands 10 yards away from you. It will take them no more than 5 seconds to reach you, at which point you can still them as they were standing 10 yards away 10 seconds ago. The first sign that you would have that they reached you would be them suddenly appearing directly in front of you, after which their motion towards you is slowly revealed in a reverse blur. Eyeball-to-eyeball you see the them, 1 second after that you can see them when they were still 1 yard away from you running towards you, then 2 seconds after that you can see them as they were 2 seconds prior, until eventually the image of them standing 10 yards ago fades. And were you to attempt to reach out to someone by you, they may no longer be in the location you reach for.

The sense of touch is unusual too, and even more so the inertia of all matter. Everything in the environment of any substance at all is firm as diamond, completely immovable and invulnerable. You cannot kick so much as a pebble, and water is solid as metal. Lighter objects yield just barely: you can, with enough force to bend metal, nudge a feather that was floating in the air, and wherever you managed to move it to, it would continue to remain suspended there. If you succeeded in moving the feather to inside your pocket, it would be very hard to walk away, as it would tear the pocket loose from your clothing and remain where it was in space.

Though clear air and gaseous forms don't resist movement, clear air is rare. A dusty room must be waded through as if through a sea of floating needlepoints. That dust, as well as water droplets from fog or even pollen, all accumulate on clothing and hair and in the lungs and will increasingly bog you down. This can be fatal!

A peculiar inversion results here. Water, quicksand, acid, and lava alike are gracious, harmless terra firma, while grass... grass is a nightmarish field of metal thorns, snapping and knifing underfoot. Worse yet, a splinter of grass lodged in boot or flesh maintains its impossible inertia, practically trapping itself there. An unlucky configuration of three such splinters buried deep out of sight in this visitor's left foot nearly caused her to spend a little longer than she would have preferred in an otherwise pastoral mountaintop tableau.

The greatest hazard of all is cumulative: each of these physical constraints---the cold, the muffle of sound and scent, the slow movement of light, the weight of all substance---slowly worsens the longer you spend in The ____. Though the exact parameters vary in a way not yet predictable, to a newly-arrived visitor another visitor already there for only hours may appear to be moving with twice the difficulty and be even slower to react to change. Attempts to aid someone in that state must overpower the increased resistance the victim is facing. Of course, remain for long enough and the tourist becomes a permanent resident, as immobile as the rest of the scene.

Visitors sealed into a tableau, artifacts left behind, or any successful attempts to move or bend lighter objects are the only known scenarios in which the state of things in this plane may not be true to the outside multiverse. Though it is an unlikely scenario given the infinite spread of space and time represented here, this fact provides a tiny seed of doubt behind the assumption that a tableau accurately reflects a real happening.

Lastly, you have read that this realm contains even itself. What does that mean? This has been experimentally proven: tableau have been found depicting The ____, that is to say, tableau of explorers visiting a tableau, and even, in one tragic recorded case, tableau of an explorer finding a tableau of explorers visiting a tableau, which will be discussed shortly.

### Culture & Paradigm

Unique among all of the ____ planes (TODO is this true), there appear to be no petitioners who make The ____ their final residence. The only beings who seem at home here are the rilmani, occasionally sighted by visitors from a distance, their slender, iridescent flesh wrapped in cloaks, carefully inspecting some detail of a tableau. Apparently unencumbered by the oppressive nature of the plane, they are swifter than any visitor and gently depart when sighted. Whether they are natives or simply frequent guests is unknown, but their presence is in keeping with their role as watchmen of multiversal balance.

Amongst those few scholars, mercenaries, and obsessives familiar with this plane, however, a small and wildly dangerous cottage industry has sprung up, accompanied by a certain camaraderie. The plane is something of a holy grail that, if tamed, would hold untold promise. It is reminiscent of that fable of the near-infinite library that contains all possible books of a certain size, which are mostly gibberish but must by necessity have among their member all past and future books, some of great knowledge and power.

The case of The ____, however, is more tantalizing, since some methods hold promise of guiding you closer to a desired moment! The beauty is that once the desired tableau has been reached, especially if this was achieved with a permanent portal that lets visitors come and go as they please to avoid the gradual burden of the place, it can be explored with none of the hazards of the original place. Enemy defenses or the location of powerful relics in a hostile environment can be explored and mapped out at leisure. One can travel to places normally inaccessible. With a suit fashioned from lotus leaves or shark skin you can swim through fog, and with a large kind of solid snowshoe you can walk on clouds if you keep moving. Lava is lukewarm to the touch and completely solid, acid too is firm and harmless, traps are never sprung, magical defenses hang helplessly in the air, treacherous paths never crumble,

Here are some desired moments your traveler has had explained excitedly to her:

- foo
- bar

discuss groups trying, how it works: complex ritual *sometimes* guides journey in. you do in certain place hoping to see that place in certain time, but sometimes it latches on to an arbitrary thing, like your boots, and takes you to a frozen scene of cobbler making them, or of your boots decaying at bottom of a river, and now you're stuck cause water is treacherous. anything can be picked up, maybe a wisp of hair, you can end up anywhere those particles were or will be. or it goes wrong and you end up in far future or past, crushed by the change in landscape.

- due to the absolute immobility of most matter, even as minor an obstacle as a closed door or window left insufficiently ajar can thwart the most dedicated of visitors, though a curtain of fine sheer silk can, with enough bludgeoning, be made to part way.

#### Transport

As with every other plane, portals connecting to locations in The ____ are scattered across the multiverse, many residing in Soblei. The vast, vast majority of these lead to uninteresting tableau or barren landscapes of the past or future or remote present. Attempts to travel to a particular time and location in this folded infinite spacetime require incredible power and are time-consuming, expensive, prone to error, and frequently fatal.

I have copied here the best efforts of TODO/name (scholar studying NNP plane) to summarize the complex mechanics of travel to, from, and within The ____:

> If one wishes to reach a specific tableau, there are three options:
>
> 1. Find an existing portal that happens to go to the right period of time, and then make one's way from there to one's desired location without dying.
> 2. Use the standard teleportation spells and rituals, which are wildly inaccurate in this case and prone to failure. In the event one achieves the desired location, one will mostly likely not achieve the desired time. Once there, one will slowly die, and upon returning to one's home plane before death, one will be unlikely to successfully return to the same tableau.
> 3. Attempt to modify an existing portal to point to a new tableau. This is prone to catastrophic failure, but if one succeeds, one may come and go as one pleases, which reduces the chance of dying.

If you are interested in the particulars I have copied here more detailed notes:

> **Portals**
>
> Pre-existing portals to The ____ are as uncommon. Most are of unknown provenance, probably the act of deities or demigods, the Wish of a magic user of vast power, unexpected cataclysms, eons of ritual, etc. They work as normal.
>
> I am aware of some successful attempts to bend an existing portal to point to a different time or location, but I am aware of no attempts that achieved both at once, and aware of many attempts that have resulted in the destruction of the portal and/or everything in the presence of the portal at the time the attempt was made.
>
> Temporary portals or gates to or from or within The ____ are almost impossible to aim accurately as I will describe shortly, but they last for normal amounts of time (as measured from the outside).
>
> **Travel within The ____**
>
> The separation of planes is preserved in The ____. I am lucky to have in my laboratory a gate to the coronation of Prince Uyik in his resplendent palace on the Elemental Plane of Mirrors. From that tableau, simpler teleportation efforts that only work within the same plane will only take one elsewhere in the Elemental Plane of Mirrors, while inter-planar transport will take one to any plane. However, no matter how one gets there, one will remain at the moment of the coronation of Print Uyik.
>
> Teleportation within The ____ is subject to the same hazards and inaccuracies a teleportation normally is, but the rate and severity of mishaps is notably increased.
>
> The only known way to move in time from within is to do some foolish action that creates a tear in reality, for example by placing a portable hole in a bag of holding. This will fling the perpetrator and those near him to a random moment in time, but usually roughly in the same place.
>
> **Travel to The ____**
>
> very inaccurate location, totally random time. helps both time and place to have object related, but you might end up at time/place of something with distant provenance but directly physical relation.
>
> **Travel from The ____**
>
> more inaccurate location, sometimes random time. again helps both time and place to have object related

### Guide

#### History

"History" is a laughable concept for a realm that contains within it the entire history of the multiverse, but some moments stand out as TODO

##### Recursive

This latter has been recorded once, with tragic end. The famous pair of scholars TODO (pair of explorers) spent a long time studying this realm, primarily learning how to visit specific tableau. explorer who was frozen, there is a portal to the moment in which he was frozen. people were able to reach separate moments which show frozen moment in time from the expedition in which he was lost. like A was frozen and B made it out, and B was able to find a scene showing both A and B, B seeing herself failing to save A. heartbreak! If they'd seen this first could they have prevented? segue into determinism stuff. The moment they saw this scene, they instantly understood what was about to happen.

someone seeing a tableau that represents their future death?

##### TODO

TODO some famous (chance) meeting here?

#### Places

##### TODO coliseum

A large cabinet under the bar at a private back room in the grimy Lukewarm Caldera in Soblei leads to possibly the most hospitable spot in the ____. The pub is of course named after the portal, which leads to nothing less than the mouth of an active volcano in the aftermath of a vast eruption. TODO describe sea

While the ____ is a famously bone-shatteringly freezing place, and the center of a bonfire is merely extremely cold, magma flows can approach pleasantly cool to the touch. And the center of this molten cataclysm is balmy enough to work up a sweat. Better yet, no one knows when or how the enormous amounts of smoke and ash and igneous chunks that must have hung in the air were cleaned out, but the atmosphere in and around the entire caldera is clean as the Plane of Air. A practically solid wall of billowing ash forms a barrier that begins just a couple dozen paces over the lip of the edge of the caldera, as well as overhead covering the whole opening. TODO would it be ash, also how bright

coliseum for interesting combat

inside caldera of volcano and it's like... cool but fine. and they laboriously cleared out the air of particles so you can move easily. coliseum, or another place?

##### TODO

plane of mirrors, unknown future or past. planar transport to all planes except elemental planes fails - because they don't exist? is this some ancient primordial past or degenerate future where only element planes exist?

(maybe quote from guy)

it's BEAUTIFUL and complex. the air is vibrantly clean and environment geometric and clear cut, so while the cold remains, physical navigation is easy. it is days before any encumbrance is noted at all. of course, the elemental planes, except for that of air, are so full of stuff as to be near instant death traps.

____ scholar in old age has given up on exploring The ____, and is now attempting to catalog the formal and complex society of blah city in the Plane of Mirrors. attempting to decipher their written language but no progress, but their visual art is astounding.

the slow light affect is CREEPY. you are constantly catching glimpses of yourself in the past, sometimes reflected across dozens of mirrors through an unexpected angle, hours ago. guy has gone in with friends etc., but he swears that he has caught moving glimpses of people he doesn't recognize, but no way of knowing if it's ancient light reflected in some arduous route of visitors from years before he obtained the portal, or if another portal exists or someone is somehow sneaking in. attempts to trace the source are through complex passageways are hopeless.

really hard to navigate, leaves breadcrumbs (what kind?)

#### Figures & Groups

anything apart from that guild?

#### Festivals & Traditions

ritual revisiting of past event. snowy mountain where something religious or whatever retrieved. or maybe they were saved, vanquished enemy, etc. it's like hajj. super snowy and difficult and you're meant to forge through snow and bring some back, though many routes are cleared out over time and good for the lazy or infirm or less dedicated. but HUGE mountain so even untold years there's plenty. snow on feet as well. do you craft your own suit/armor? passed down? shield?

#### Rumors & Mysteries

##### Extent in Space

@TODO how to replace Sigil and Outlands and spire with Soblei?

To be clear, The ____ doesn't reflect only the prime material plane. It holds everything---the Inner and Outer Planes, the Astral and the Ethereal, wildspace, the Hinterlands, all of it, even the Far Realm. The one exception, perhaps, is Sigil. Tableau of the Outlands are plentiful (notably, magic is not suppressed in tableau there) from which of course you can see Sigil atop the infinite Spire. But since the Spire is infinitely tall, there seems no way to reach Sigil. Must it be there, if it can be seen, replicated in total detail, holding all its secrets? For the slim price of overcoming this plane's natural hazards, we could explore the City of Doors at leisure, unmolested by the Lady or her servants!

If Sigil is here, why have all attempts to reach tableau there failed? One theory is that the giant torus visible from the Outlands is not actually Sigil, which itself resides in some pocket demiplane. This wouldn't directly explain the lack of Sigil tableau, but would allow for the apparent visibility of Sigil from tableau of the Outlands without Sigil's interior being accessible, while some other explanation must be found for while Sigil alone is missing.

##### Extent in Time

The endless expanse of time appears to be fully represented. Tableau of ancient primordial scenes have been found, before the gods as we know them were formed. Distant futures have been found too: metropolises of teeming utopias and dystopias (but absent motion and social contact, it may be hard to tell which is which) as well as cold entropic wastelands. Technological marvels would reveal themselves if only their inventors could be spoken with, or their inventions were

future moments seem to exist, but it's unclear if this shows the future is deterministic, or if multiple future moments exist. no one has yet found two incompatible future moments, but are actively searching. (example of close call but not clear if incompatible)

##### Passage of Time

Light travels about 300,000,000m/s. Time passes about a billion times slower here, so light travels about 1ft/second. hold your hand out and move it, takes about 1 second before you see it move. So extremely cold because molecules moving billionth as fast, everything is basically absolute zero.  No sound, unless you're really, really close. Moving is hard and gets harder. Touch works normal. Smell works but never travels. Maybe it's like "soul juice" that allows things to move, but which light doesn't have, but an arrow does.

#### Visiting

### GM Guide

#### Conditions

Most dangers of the original plane are neutralized here, leaving only the natural dangers of The ____. The only things that remain harmful are:

- Pointy and sharp things still damage, often worse than they would normally due to their stiffness (e.g. grass)
- Crushing: if you for some reason end up trapped in some way, it's still a problem
- Suffocation: if you are somewhere with no air breathable by you, you will suffocate
- Heat: even the center of the plane of fire is merely warm, maybe a little hot. The center of the sun will still kill you.
- Noxious fumes: Gases behave normally, so carbon monoxide, for instance, would be harmful. Of course, if there's no oxygen (or whatever you need) you will suffocate. Noxious things in the air that are solid particulates (ash, say) will not cause the normal harm for they do not interact the way they normally would, but they will accumulate in your lungs (unless you take precautions) and slow you down and even tear at your insides, and any particulates that you bring back with you into the regular world will then do any harm they would do at that point.
- Things which, just by their mere sight, would driver a viewer mad are still dangerous to behold, for instance in the Far Realms. The effect tends to be less powerful though, and visitors with much preparation who are very familiar with the conditions of tableau are able to train and steel themselves to treat it is a harmless facsimile or the original.

How long until stuff bogs you down? A very dusty room or thick fog is challenging immediately, and within hours impenetrable. On the clearest of days you would move freely at first, within hours encumbered by tiny dust, pollen, other particulates, and by a day or two would be trapped.

#### Transport

Permanent Teleportation Circle requires casting every day for 100 years. Existing permanent circles on the plane that you know the sigils of you can go to that location, but utterly random time.

Plane Shift works for location, but random time.

Teleport works as normal, but the "same plane" means same plane as you're currently on in that tableau, and same slice of time.

The Gate spell doesn't let anything enter the plane, only works to leave the plane.

Wish works to teleport in to a desired location precisely, but still only 20% chance of the exact moment you wanted, 20% it's +/- minutes, 20% chance it's +/- hours, 20% chance it's +/- days, 20% it's +/- years. Wish may also alter an existing portal to change its location precisely, and its time with the same % chances of error, and it remains permanent.

## True Neutral Destruction NND

- something about an attention snap, like the transition i have from focusing on breathing to "let you mind be free" (and be thoughtless), that. these guys with their crazy power of attention that can wreak havoc, they seem to "envelop" the thing in their attention, and when they all simultaneously stop thinking, the thing stops existing. it's like things exist only by virtue of attention being paid to it, and the strength (in individual and in numbers) of their attention swamps the attention of bystanders, such that when they stop, it's like the thing stops existing.
	- Many things have been proposed to explain the variance of numbers of monks present for a disappearance. The most obvious was "size", but TODO/metaphysists find this an arbitrary quality, and a handful of examples, such as a lone monk sighted on a rowboat off an uninhabited island disappearing an entire coral reef, give the lie to this, unless some monks are far more "powerful" than others. Another proposal is "importance", although this is hard to measure, and what is the "importance" of TODO. The best candidate is "attention" from which a plausible theory of a mechanism has been generated, and indeed the only known successful defense against a disappearance attempt, along with the only known apparent delay (but failed defense).
	- TODO (how to merge this with the sight thing and the kid)
	- TODO (maybe explain "attention" after the anecdotes)
	- TODO (relative amounts of attention relative to intelligence/consciousness)
	- TODO (only successful defense, about 20 monks, about a thousand sit-in visitors drishti-ing on the to-be-dissapeared thing, maybe number of monks grew and number (and training) of defenders grew, was this HUGE thing, and the monks gave up. TODO (BUT WAIT this violates the thing where you never know what's going to be disappeared, maybe it was some isolated circumstance so it was obvious, but does this violate coolness of "never can be guessed?"))
- TODO erasure? slating? like blank slate
- something about art using unconscious control? but destruction art? see thing from kris (and can i name it after her or something. or ask her for something that'll be part of it)
	- ~"express unconscious mind directly through art, unmediated expression, uncover metaphysical truths by relinquishing conscious control"~
	- what is destruction art?

*The ____*

Obliterating zen monks who aim for ultimate nothingness? Maybe the ritualistic culture ("lucid body, spacious mind, empty heart") I've written about elsewhere, or that could be a different one.

Jordan Peterson quote about what you (choose to) pay attention to determines everything you experience

Bone white marble lattice in infinite whiteness

Infinitely tall marble pillars in infinitely large hall (not destruction enough?)

In some places, harmonic vibrations resonate your bones and guts, tremors starting fuzzy big and wide, then sharp and crack and divide, split you apart from the inside.

Different regions vibrate differently: some will destroy only certain kinds of objects, some will destroy anything. Different Monks find themselves at home and in comfort in different regions.

Maybe white? White is the purest of destruction, white is the color when nothing is there. White is the color of thoughts stripped bare. White shows the mind the way it would be. White brings to mind the nothing-to-see. White has no form, no texture, no grain. White clears the storm, the pleasure, the strain.

White sky - not bright, but absolutely white. No cloud, no aurorae, no texture or shade.

The monks claim no magical abilities, but merely the ability to have complete control over their attention. They say that beings waste insane amounts of strength by the fact that most of their attention is not under their control, that there is a constant background torrent of leaking attention. Everything is superfluous to them. It's not unknown for a monk partaking in ritual to squeeze so much attention out of their beings that the blood stops flowing in their veins, the skin stops holding in the flesh, resulting in the petitioner's structural form failing, and their essence being unified with the obliterative strength of the plane. Sometimes during Erasure ceremonies, monks are known to vanish while outside of their home, their essence presumably dispersing.

Their attention causes vibrations, the vibrations obliterate. Or rather, discuss difference between attention and awareness. The focus so much attention on the object, to the exclusion of awareness, that when the all simultaneously (how do they time it?) open up to a broad awareness, it's like a massive vacuum that sucks the thing into nonexistence. This is why if anyone else is paying attention, it doesn't work.

They seek out (or hate?) actors and musicians and models---they've soaked up so much attention.


#### Erasures

Ritualistic. Rarely, a cadre will coalesce for an Erasure, where they go en masse to some location and erase something---a building, a city, a lake, an artifact. The Monks will be seen congregating, silently and peacefully, in an area. They defend themselves with deadly and precise psychic force when threatened, but otherwise their techniques seem more subtle. Vibrations and noises, sometimes blurring or fuzzy muffling of sounds, will be evident, at a range corresponding to the size of the object being erased and the number of Monks participating. The to-be-erased object eventually vanishes. It happens suddenly, and the monks vanish simultaneously.

When the monks gather, it is never clear what is going to be Erased. Generally the number of monks present and the duration of their stay indicate the size of what will be Erased: a handful may congregate for a day to erase an ancient oak tree, while hundreds march weeks to erase a mountain range. However their force may indicate power instead of size: an entire city could be filled with monks for days, only to vanish without any sign of what they erased, which may have been a small but forceful artifact, or, very rarely, a powerful mortal life.

No one witnesses the actual moment of Erasure---it always happens during a blink or when glancing away from something. It's said that staring at a thing, holding eyelids open so as not to blink, can prevent the monks from erasing it. However, since it is never clear what the monks will erase or exactly when it will happen, it's impossible to purposefully employ this tactic. Even beings of immense clairvoyance whose physiology allow flawless unblinking, omnidirectional gaze, do not consume all the available information at any given time, and move their attention from time to time. During these times, an object will be erased. Erasures are rare (example using some civilization), though a handful of beings are known to be have been the presence of more than one. Infamously, mighty wizard TODO/name (haughty wizard) who deemed every speck of dust in his dwelling to be in absolute focus in his mind at all times, found after several days of a half dozen monks that his TODO (important wizard belonging) vanished while he was in the same room having just used it. Maybe happened twice, first time was further away.

Skeptics argue that this aspect of erasure proves that there is no being in the universe that is truly omniscient, or who is both omniscient and holds everything in attention at once---for if this were the case, nothing could ever be erased.

Academic observers have attempted to identify a system to what they erase, and the dominant narrative is that the monks maintain a multiversal balance by erasing TODO stuff at extremes. However, far too many observed erasures have seemingly no connection to this. The TODO/organization, a group of mostly gnomes who TODO, have made it a pastime and competition of documenting erasures, the most successful of which, TODO/name (winning gnome), has personally witnessed an astounding seven monk gatherings (a record), though in only 4 of those was the erased object identified (TODO/name (runner up gnome) holds the record for identified erasures, having traced 5, though first gnome maintains that the 5th is wrong and so they're tied for it.) TODO how do the gnomes find them?

It's unknown whether monks ever gather outside their plane for purposes other than erasure, though many gatherings have resulted in no erasure found.

TODO what do they do during ritual? Nothing much, but something.

TODO what tone/frame/form should next paragraph take? Could be "I once met a guy..." but narration should be more authoritative and not have "I". Could be a blockquoted thing, like a journal entry. What else?

One report of a being who had a hunch about what would be erased TODO/building (but not a religious shrine, what) and resolved to stare at it as the monks swirled around. He held his eyelids open, drying, TODO describe, for days. Eventually it happened. He could still see the structure, but his vision became surreal and uncomfortable to witness TODO describe. Indeed the structure had not been erased in his vision, but it seemed to be an after image, or another existence superimposed upon his normal one. He could see passersby react as if the structure were gone (in shock, etc), but the structure still stood. And though the final moment of erasure is accompanied by the monks vanishing, in his vision, the monks remained. And they were *busy*. But his vision bubbled and blurred. They were disassembling the structure perhaps, or re-building it, or arranging something inside it or modifying it somehow. TODO more interesting, maybe they're panicked that the watcher will fuck everything up. The after-image became stranger and stranger. Suddenly, a sneeze shook him, and though he swore his managed to keep his eyes open, it was no use---his attention was diverted for a fraction of a second. The monks and the structure were gone, and so was his vision: he was blind for the rest of his life

# **Chaotic Neutral**

## Chaotic Neutral Creation CNC

- the Mutatorium in the Plane of Creation could instead be this? Or the dream-creators (if oppositional to nightmares) could be this (or a place located here)?
- artists, creative madness.?
- it's said that here more than any other outer outer plane, the membrane between reality and the Plane of Creation is thinned to a near breaking point.
- a gorgeous crazy world where *thought* is not possible, only observation
- observations are not quite reliable, they constantly flower with related or plausible images and variations - when you observe a boy, you also see a baby, a grown man, a woman, a tiger cub. when you perceive a castle, you also perceive a manor, a fortified wall, a dungeon, a floating island, an army. each observation leads to more observations, it's almost impossible to get one's bearing.
- a technique is to wear these pinhole goggles (not so pinhole that you get a full image like pinhole camera) so that you perceive as little as possible at once, so there's less branching. a similar technique has not been developed for hearing, since earmuffs equally dim all sound, but what is desired is a narrowing of sound. so total sound blockage is used, along with nose, since smell is a particularly evocative sense and the smells are myriad. touch TODO
- constant festival?
- what is it actually like? there's a recurring image of a boy in a chariot who seems to be a local deity, or perhaps there are many and they are the inhabitants.

*The Something*

A barren void. A pulsating fractal rainbow riverbed. A boy in a chariot. A waterfall up from the soil. A purple hedge bleeding out birds. A branching catacomb through translucent rock. A spire on a cliff. A pedestal topped by lizards. A drop of water. A lightning strike turns the lake to ice. A snake peeks its head out of a hole---or is it a whip, a belt, a rope? A sudden calm. A pit in the gut. A ring, a ringing. A gust of rosemary. An orchid leaps to life, a praying mantis. A flute lays eggs. A mountain coils and sings. A chariot rides its wave, a boy dismounts. A labyrinth, a maze, a mission, a foe, a dialog, an image, a geyser, a trickle. A boy in a chariot, a frown, a smile. A gate. A library of colors. The color of noise. A warm welcome.

## Chaotic Neutral Preservation CNP

	TODO/maybe Decay is inherent in all compound things. Work out your own salvation with diligence. –Last words of the Buddha

(linked to LND)

Basically an embodiment of the second law of thermodynamics. They are the mechanism by which the multiverse ensures that entropy always increases!

They organize into collectives around particular domains of entropy. One is all about dissolving political union: a moral entropy as opposed to a physical, material entropy. One is about combustion and physical state change. One is about aging. Weakening of the powers of gods? One is about irreversible food transformations, and in this otherwise chaotic and hazardous plane there is a fantastical culinary outpost where the most innovative epicureans spew their creations, and where the most amazing blah blah.

Maybe even dryad-like spirits of specific entropic forces? Or demi gods, like the god of broken furniture, cooked eggs, romantic miscommunications, plans gone awry, and poorly sealed buried treasure/time capsules slowly decomposing.

@TODO(remove copyright) Aligned with the Doomguard of Sigil, who believe that entropy is inevitable and divine. The Doomguard are connoisseurs and guardians of entropy, while CNP are its agents, and their characters differ greatly. While the Doomguard can be quite cheerful about their cynicism and nihilism, it doesn't compare to the sheer glee of CNP. These guys have more fun than any other plane in the multiverse. they are *boisterous*.

Actually, the 2nd law says entropy never decreases---in some ideal states of equilibrium or reversible processes, entropy can remain the same. Controversy! Weakness! Heresy! (Perfectly reversible processes are physically impossible, but practically you can get close, but there's always waste/heat). Perfect equilibrium (like eventual heat death of the universe?) is their nightmare or their dream?

Entropy is often (always?) increased in the process of doing work and generating heat. So activities of this plane generate heat (maybe absorbs heat from entropic processes across the multiverse). Plane is very hot, and/or has insanely cold reservoir that heat is transferred to (maybe some portal, maybe plane of fire?).

Heat always flows from a region of higher temperature to one with lower temperature until temperature becomes uniform. Different temperatures is lower entropy, all same is max entropy. (i don't get this: all same temp seems like the most "ordered" of all. am i missing something, or is "high entropy = disorder, low entropy = order" inaccurate? it's more like... low entropy is potential to do work)

"thermodynamic free energy is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform"

if entropy is reduced in one subsystem, it is increased at least as much or more in another subsystem

that german artist?

mention, maybe with relationship one, the celebration of abandoning the sunk cost, all that effort for nothing, yes!

one is just explosions, groups roam the periphery of the procession picking up bits and pieces and assembling them into meager sculptures which they burn or smash on little anvil-topped carts or grind

"Entropy, like temperature, is an abstract concept, yet, like temperature, everyone has an intuitive sense of the effects of entropy. Watching a movie, it is usually easy to determine whether it is being run forward or in reverse. When run in reverse, broken glasses spontaneously reassemble, smoke goes down a chimney, wood "unburns", cooling the environment and ice "unmelts" warming the environment. No physical laws are broken in the reverse movie except the second law of thermodynamics." wiki article on entropy. are there more ways to increase entropy than decrease? many ways to smash a glass, but only one way to put it back together

> Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law. Like the refrigerators. Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings energy, in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy. The apparent paradox between the second law of thermodynamics and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems has its resolution in the energy that enters the biosphere from outside sources. Entropy reduction is a general characteristic of life.

also:

> The canonical counterexample [of a non-living thing that decreases local entropy] is a hurricane. Like a living organism, it increases the entropy of its environment (in this case by transporting heat from the warm ocean surface to the cold upper atmosphere) in order to maintain its own, localised low-entropy structure. This structure is low-entropy in part because it involves highly correlated motions of air molecules, i.e. wind. [...] Sand dunes, fire and ocean waves could all be described the same way, although they're not as nicely localised as a hurricane.

also talk about arrow of time, these guys have a sacred duty?

*The Inevitability*

This realm embodies and safeguards a primal force in the multiverse: entropy. Barring hypothetical states of perfect equilibrium or reversibility, all systems lie precariously on an irreversible slide from order into disorder, a fact known to some scholars as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The gleeful inhabitants of The Inevitability are the ones that propagate this. Grouped into collectives concerned with various manifestations of entropy -- combustion and other physical state changes, aging, irreversible food transformations, decay, as well as less material forms of entropy, such as political dissolution, failed relationships, and the fading of divine powers -- natural forces summon the plane's residents, the Unravelers, across the multiverse to shepherd these transformations, after which they return to the plane with stories and evidence of their successes. This is a place bursting with exuberance and action, driven by a frenzy to consume all of the potential work and energy available to them. The party here will end only when across all of reality every building has crumbled, the last fires have gone out, and the final gods have been laid to rest.

### Environment

On a first visit to The Inevitability a visitor is likely to find an empty, flat, blasted wasteland, graced only by the occasional low hills or stiff breeze. The ground is a hard-packed grey mixture of fine dust and ash, covered in a loose layer of dust and ash. Dust and ash hang lightly in the air beneath a sky the color of dust and ash. Close inspection reveals minute flecks and granules of varying colors and materials ground into the fine powder and blending to nothing from any distance. Occasional artifacts of life lie lost in the dirt: a piece of eggshell, a tuft of hair, a fragment of cloth, a scrap of parchment or metal. But the Procession is never very far away, and somehow always finds its way to visitors.

First it can be felt (a vague juddering of the earth) and then it can be heard (a murmur of revelry and snatches of music on a faint gust). Then it can be spied on the horizon: a plume of particulates different from yet eventually constituting the dust and ash below. Beneath the rising smoke, or whatever suspension of colors hangs muted by the distance, is movement that rides astride the horizon with the inexorability of a wildfire and the force of a stampeding herd of buffalo.

The Procession has no beginning or end, and snakes its way across The Inevitability at a slow crawl, segments stretching and contracting and shifting in their paths without ever becoming disconnected from the greater continuity. It always approaches faster than expected and suddenly its edge is upon you, deafening and roiling with blaring chaos and purpose and glee, inexhaustible, exhausting. No two sections of this infinite carnival are alike in anything but their fervor and movement. Those who journey away from the Procession across the blank land inevitably find themselves approached by another far-flung portion of the same endless parade.

### Culture & Paradigm

The first seven Unravelers this visitor asked for the name of their home related seven different monikers---The Inevitability, The Inexorability, The Irrevocability, The Irreversibility, The Inescapability, The Irresistibility, The Ineluctability---at which point it is just as well to give up. Other less philosophical names arise too: The Churn, The Mess, The Unpacking, The Dissolution, The Relaxation. Scholars have generally settled on The Inevitability. Regardless of what name they use to describe it, Unravelers who can be distracted from their festivity are universally elated to describe the workings of their land and their role within it.

The Procession is formed out of a series of troupes concerning themselves with particular flavors and subjects of entropy, each with their own methods and personalities. In the broadest strokes the main difference between troupes lies along a kind of class distinction. The troupes concerned with more physical matters, like rotting food and certain weather patterns, are viewed as coarser and more primitive than those that deal in more abstract subjects like political instability or spilled secrets. These form a spectrum middled by complexer endeavors such as crumbling architecture and @TODO(middle-brow entropic endeavor)

BLAH but they all share glee and respect for the mission

chanting repeating "hear hear!"

*TODO The Troupe of Failed Relationships*

Upon the shoulders of an albino orc rides a flagrantly voluptuous tiefling woman, nude but draped in straps and chains and satchels bursting with thousands of wedding rings and other courtship jewelry. ____s crowd around, presenting more stolen offerings, announcing them with glee.

"An engagement brooch gifted by Marian of Moare unto Nerile of Alvarus: its loss confirms to Marian his uncertainty about their impending marriage!" the orc passes the brooch to the woman on his shoulders, who seizes it and shrieks "his uncertainty about their impending marriage!"

"These two wedding bands of Nestor and Iranda of Orsic, liberated by gloves removed after a cold day of hard work, their loss symbolizing their mutually growing dispassion and carelessness!" The woman holds them aloft, singing "their mutually growing dispassion and carelessness!"

In the procession behind them floats a large palanquin overflowing with satin and gold, resting above deep purple flames and mounted by succubi and incubi regaling the giddy crowd with tales of how they led lovers astray. At appropriate moments the crowd crows in unison about the unfortunate pair "and they never rejoined again!"

Next are the dream doubtlings: insightful and petty sprites who twist the characters of those in dreams---the reason why the dreamt version of your lover so often betrays and disappoints. A series of towering black wagons, each its own twisted shrine groping upward, rattle forward towed by teams of glinting scaled buffalo. The dream doubtlings swarm the wagons, painting small icons with scenes of confusion and dissonance slipped into sleeping minds, leaving as offerings the relics gathered from their degenerate wanderings.

The march presents every romantic discord imaginable. These ____s scour the multiverse and return with the stories and mementos of their spoils: arguments rehashed ad nauseam, miscommunications entrenched, wandering eyes tempted, widowings celebrated, unrequited infatuations goaded, doubts sewn, tempers boiled, backs stabbed, families sundered, promises mocked.

relationships are not tampered with without cause, but then again a cause can nearly always be found. gazing at the wanton crowd, your traveler searched and found no malice. in fact, she joined in the revelry for a time, finding resonance in the finitude of TODO, joining the call-and-response even, cathartic, a community joined together by celebration of dissolution. One mortal found there was so wooed that he had abandoned his life (a strict TODO/lifestyle) to join the parade. He is surely not the only one to have done so.

*loss of knowledge*

books, libraries, oral texts forgotten, etc.

offshoot of guild obsessed with NNP (or some other guild) come here to gather knowledge? the locals think it's hilarious, they do not stop them, they know that entropy will find them in the end.

*crystallization?*

> Entropic forces are important and widespread in the physics of colloids,[22] where they are responsible for the depletion force, and the ordering of hard particles, such as the crystallization of hard spheres, the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystal phases of hard rods, and the ordering of hard polyhedra.[22][23] Because of this, entropic forces can be an important driver of self-assembly

Arrow of time. "The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to reversal of the time direction. The second law has been proposed to supply an explanation of the difference between moving forward and backwards in time, such as why the cause precedes the effect". These guys are responsible for the process of time. Without them, there would be no assurance that cause precedes effect. Without that certainty, all logic and order fall apart.

Scholarly controversy, minority wish to swap CNP and CND?

But it's not destruction because matter and energy are never destroyed, it is only transmuted into a disordered state: in fact a more stable state. Every molecule is accounted for and remains disordered and undistinguished on the ashen wastes of this plane.

## Chaotic Neutral Destruction CND

Voiders? The Wilt?

maybe NED, or even NEP

An endless gray plain of enormous geometric holes in the ground, like that exhibit at DIA Beacon, also Chichu. Each void is inhabited by a single individual, residing in indefinite inertia and dissolution.

How do they end up there? Punishment, if NED. Apathy, giving up, failing. OR: people who just really really want to be alone.

They very very rarely talk to each other but will sometimes go on a pilgrimage to journey to another hole.

In one pit, two exhausted former partners fighting it out infinitely. Famously sought out for their wisdom, but sometimes you have to wait a long while until they exhaust themselves, and they never respond directly to your queries (this has been attempted).

Another pit is what people call "the anointed". It's huge, and appears to be infinitely deep, but a cylindrical pillar rises up from the depth to a height some distance below the rim of the hole. on it is a small plateau, with a patch of grass, on which a man sleeps. somehow sunlight shines on him

The arrangement of holes changing/unpredictable somehow? Holes slowly close up sometimes, inevitably trapping and crushing their resident, who invariably accept their fate with apathy.

Peaceful.

# **Lawful Evil**

## Lawful Evil Creation LEC

Labyrinthine catacombs where the some of the smartest minds in the multiverse plot intricate evil schemes. It's an immense civilization subdivided into self-organizing groups which tackle certain domains/styles TODO examples. Lower castes scheme smaller schemes, while barons and dukes plot the downfall of entire cultures. What they actually *accomplish*, however, is a complete mystery. Residents are never seen to leave the plane or communicate with those outside it, and all plans seen by outsiders seem to have no correlation to reality, e.g. plan to pollute the bloodline of a noble family over generations in order to watch a benevolent kingdom turn slowly upon its trusting populace, replete with incredibly specific details of allies and turncoats, locations to infiltrate, TODO, etc., but which refers to a place and bloodline that no outsiders can find.

Is the multiverse too big? Is the plan somehow removed from the normal flow of time such that plans reference ancient things or predict and plan for things not yet come to pass? Are the plans expertly obfuscated such that spying outsiders never understand them? Neighboring powers tread carefully for fear of attracting the ire of this plane's denizens, so we can only assume that many of the longest cons and most devastating corruptions can be traced back to this plane. We can only assume.

Could be like Barbarella society, decadent

## Chaotic Evil Creation CEC

Pestilence garden.

Playground full of children? Protected "utopia" where they can "play"

A place of charismatic demagogues, rapidly gaining and losing favor. Constant attempts at civilization that invariably fall prey to groupthink and demagoguery, performative allegiance to the current trend, infighting over its true nature, etc. But the only thing more nauseating than the constant superficial political infighting is blah glee.

Tin Drum! Nurgle. Lord of the Flies.

Whether it's society or nature that shapes children into adults that, generally, give a fuck, whatever it is, it's missing here. This is the land of glee. Actually, what it is is consequence. Consequences, real encounters as well as their potential, are what shape society. This land is free from consequence, not necessarily by its absence but by its unpredictability. An old glove abandoned on the ground may blossom into a 5-tendriled rose, may begin digging along the ground for manure, or may simply lie there, tantalizingly unchanged. There's nothing to learn in an environment where randomness reigns. The illusion of information presents itself, locally, but no generalizable conclusions may be drawn. And so the children learn nothing, for there is nothing to learn. There is only play, but play that is devoid of meaning, for children play as a way to learn about the environment, to practice, and to strengthen bonds. But bonds do not last here and there is nothing to learn, so behind the playing there is nothing. So the children play harder, to attempt to satisfy the itch which play scratches. It does not work, you cannot blame them. And so they play very hard indeed.

play can be structured and goal-oriented, has rules, life is about learning rules (patterns), so is play. supports physical development (hand eye coordination etc.) so the kids become VERY good at certain kinds of play. make believe. play fighting. play to emulate work or adult stuff.

make believe play:

- object substitution. maybe they make it real!
- role play. also made real?
	- "Relational role play, usually the first to emerge, is based on relationships that the child observes or experiences. Such relationships include mother and child, father and child, husband and wife, etc. Functional role play emphasizes on the jobs and actions that the character usually performs. Character role play portrays the character's stereotypical features usually determined by society's representation of them"
	- "Complex forms of role play involve the ability of the child to represent another individual's mental representation. This skill appears when a child is around 5 years of age. This strengthens the child's social ability by allowing him/her to take another individual's perspective and can therefore understand and cooperate with others."
- Nonliteral actions
	- "performing a task without the presence of a necessary instrument, such as pretending to make a call without using an actual phone"
	- "substitution, in that the child might use a block rather than a telephone to make a phone call"
	- "takes the role of another individual and performs their usual actions, such as pretending to be a firefighter and extinguishing a fire"
	- "certain action results in an unrealistic outcome, such as a child pretending to clean the room by simply snapping a finger"
	- "giving an inanimate object, such as a doll, animate qualities, such as talking and drinking tea"
- "It is important for a child to always understand that pretense is isolated from the real world. This means that the child must understand the nonliteral aspect of pretend play and understand that the changes made during pretend play are temporary. Children must be aware that once the play session ends, the nonliteral aspects of pretend play such as role taking and substituted objects also cease to exist."
	- imaginary friends are persistent though!
- therapeutic
	- "According to the psychodynamic view, people (especially children) will engage in play behavior in order to work through their interior obfuscations and anxieties."
	- "Non-directive play therapy, also called client-centred and unstructured play therapy, is guided by the notion that if given the chance to speak and play freely under optimal therapeutic conditions, troubled children and young people will be able to resolve their own problems and work toward their own solutions."
		- "when a family works together on a sandtray, the therapist may make several observations, such as unhealthy alliances, who works with whom, which objects are selected to be incorporated into the sandtray, and who chooses which objects. A therapist may assess these choices and intervene in an effort to guide the formation of healthier relationships"
	- "An example of a more directive approach to play therapy, for example, can entail the use of a type of desensitization or relearning therapy, to change troubling behaviors, either systematically or through a less structured approach. The hope is that through the language of symbolic play, such desensitization will likely take place"
		- who/what comes in and directs the play? leader kids?

what powers do the kids have?

types of play: improvisation or pretence, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking. Improvisation, composition, invention.

There's no such thing as a mistake, just your art takes a new direction

Small group of extremely resilient and dedicated gardeners who have figured out how to harness the chaos and protect themselves from the curious children and have carved out the most beautiful walled garden. Adults, children, or neither? They go into the wild and return with clippings of their favorites.

Ouroboros: filled with giant ouroboros thrashing and crashing through landscape eating everything in search of their tails, which they often catch, falling into devouring loop. inhabitants routinely eat themselves. aura makes things regenerate.

churning landscape, maybe geometric or runic? maybe no solid ground, like clouds and mud and geysers of steam and lava.

the way to protect yourself from the ouroboros is to get them to catch their own tails, which distracts them for a while, maybe forever? each ouroboros is extremely unique, and ones which were self eating have later been seen to be no longer self eating, but no one has ever seen the transition. what happens? does it just... stop? does it... succeed? maybe they constantly grow at crazy speed, so unless they eat themselves, they just get enormous.
