    So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloudshadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that something is happening with you, that life has not forgotten you. You do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you.

summary: Floating stony crags and tendrils wind through the endless sky and wind of the Cicatrix, in which the Alters bear the verging currents of catharsis from across the multiverse, celebrating and mourning the passage of things in visceral ritual until the land and their own bodies become more scar than substance. As the airborne land slowly rotates, memorials eventually slip into the sky and are lost.

intro: |

    The rocky crags and overhangs of the Cicatrix are as scarred and gnarled as the Alters who reside there dancing in tears and bliss and laughter on the knife edge between the devastating meaninglessness and excruciating meaningfulness of life. The Alters watch the ship sinking, the dead eulogized, the marathon completed, the commitment abandoned, and the knot untied. They feel the joy and the pain of these moments, and they are present when the pain and the joy are released moments or years later.

    Alters appear more scar than body, each bearing this in their own way: with equanimity and absurdism, with ebullient disregard, with violence and mirth. Their scars are their selves, twisted in directions both chosen and accepted. In eulogies of bloodletting and glossolalia riddles the Alters paint, pierce, and scarify their bodies, and in these same rituals the landscape is marked: memorialized with carvings, murals, and fields of stelae until the rock is as transfigured as the Alters.

    No terra firma holds the Cicatrix; instead layers of stone wind through the sky forming peaks and plateaus, giving way to rocky tendrils that protrude at all angles through clouds and bridging distant land masses: the rest is all sky. The entire structure unpredictably rotates under a warm sun, a movement perceptible only on the order of many years. Monuments and gravestones and at times even Alters or whole chunks of land eventually slip into the sky; full-grown trees hold on to ever more precarious clifftops; and carvings, artifacts, and REF[apertures] are lost in far-fetched underhangs for aeons before becoming accessible again. A violent wind curls through the Cicatrix, ensuring alongside the gradual rotation that only the most enduring memorials survive, and even so, the land is everywhere thick with them.

    While Alters bear the REF[verging](verges) currents of catharsis across the multiverse, visitors are welcome to find their own here in person. Bring a matter to be commemorated or to be rid of, and you will be joined in a worthy ritual: a troupe of Alters to scream with you to tears, an effigy constructed upon a pedestal to be destroyed, or a precipice from which to fling an object into the sky. Of course, the thing you are forced to let go of is rarely what you came to release.

the point:

- how to know what to move on from and when
- how to move on
- the joy of letting go
- ayy lmao, devastatingly meaningless and excruciatingly meaningful

- name
    + The Cicatrix (the scar of a healed wound e.g. on plant) <--
    + The Ligature
    + The Marrow
    + guess could be Lattice/Reticulum
- demonym
	+ Alters
	+ Ligands/Ligates
	+ Marrows TODO maybe this
- quotes
- environment
	+ very very windy
	+ graveyards
	+ every surface scarred with carvings and stelae - they're really really cool, huge
	+ gravity is directly towards the nearly-unmoving sun, so apart from ledges and underhanging caves you don't get direct sunlight, but daylight floods the air and reflects from other land so yeah. but it rotates slowly
	+ the land itself bears wounds
	+ gravity - can you knock stuff off?
- culture
	- how things fade and release tells you about the nature of the *present* of the thing (sorta opposite of glitch thing)
	- ayy lmao
	- fuck your burn?
	- somewhat dangerous?
	- tattooed and weird petitioners?
	- kinda punk
	- speaking in riddles
	- laughter
	- darkly absurdist
	- some petitioners seem more scar than being, but with good will, they are themselves, twisted in directions they chose or at least willingly leant into
	- TODO example ceremonies
		+ petitioner listens, you walk, it's beautiful
		+ solo time, dark night of the soul, it's beautiful
		+ purging
		+ bring something
			* burn it
			* toss it
			* eulogize it
			* memorialize it
		+ bloodletting, scarification
		    * Some kind of bloodletting ceremony, maybe for summoning, their blood turns into something, after they have gone through some intense emotional experience or something - or leave summoning part for something else, and just regular bloodletting?
		+ like the Midsommar screaming one
		+ you put a construct on a pedestal and sing its praises and then smash it - graveyard of empty pedestals
			* maybe higher impact: you're in a makeshift room with the pedestal, and afterwards the walls are let down and you see all the other empty pedestals. and then you smash it?
- cardinal interaction
	- catharsis
	- they sometimes appear to mortals - in what form?
		+ the house burned down that relieved a burden, etc.
	- helping mortals move on
	- burdens are forgotten by getting sucked in here for brief commemoration
