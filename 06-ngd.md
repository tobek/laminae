HUMOR: just laughing at it. ayy lmao

Cathartic sacrificial/purging rituals? Celebratory graveyard/memorializing?

Sacrificers: bring something you are done with or want to get rid of (or celebrate in a blaze of glory) and a ritual will be created around it, its essence split up and dispersed. Or maybe like a graveyard where everything is done appropriate justice, eulogized by incredible orators. Bloodletting.

Blissful letting go. But the thing you are forced to let go of is rarely the thing you came to let go of.

Graveyard?

- quotes
	- "if you want something, don't ask for nothing. / if you want nothing, don't ask for something." - futureheads (NGD, CGD)
	- "Should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the beauty of their carvings." ― Elisabeth Kübler-Ross NGP NGD CGD
	- "if you want something, don't ask for nothing. / if you want nothing, don't ask for something." - futureheads (NGD, CGD)
	- "So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloudshadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that something is happening with you, that life has not forgotten you. Why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any miseries, or any depressions? For after all, you do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you." - rilke - CGP? NGD
- environment
	+ very very windy
	+ flower kings no ground is known, sunset
	+ graveyards
	+ every surface scarred with carvings and stelae
	+ the structure is very slowly rotating unpredictably, perceptible on the order of many years, graveyards fall off, full-grown trees hold on for dear life, leaving carvings and well-adhered artifacts and, challengingly, apertures in unusually hard-to-reach places
	+ gravity is directly towards the nearly-unmoving sun, so apart from ledges and underhanging caves you don't get direct sunlight, but daylight floods the air and reflects from other land so yeah. but it rotates slowly
- culture
	- fuck your burn?
	- somewhat dangerous?
	- tattooed and weird petitioners?
	- kinda punk
	- laughter
	- some petitioners seem more scar than being, but with good will, they are themselves, twisted in directions they chose or at least willingly leant into
	- TODO example ceremonies
		+ petitioner listens, you walk, it's beautiful
		+ solo time, dark night of the soul, it's beautiful
		+ bring something
			* burn it
			* sink it
			* eulogize it?
			* memorialize it
		+ bloodletting, scarification
		+ like the Midsommar screaming one
		+ you put a construct on a pedestal and sing its praises and then smash it - graveyard of empty pedestals
			* maybe higher impact: you're in a makeshift room with the pedestal, and aftewards the walls are let down and you see all the other empty pedestals. and then you smash it?
- cardinal interaction
	- they sometimes appear to mortals - in what form?
		+ the house burned down that relieved a burden, etc.
	- darkly absurdist?

info gathering

- questions
- future research
- elements
	- doppelganger - you see yourself and are compelled to...
	- everyone missing a sense - why?
	- bloodletting ceremony, maybe summoning, transformation, intense experience
	- apophatic, describing by what it's not
	- something where everything is like a play, or all interactions are formulaic - NGD?
	- glitch? understanding how it breaks
	- generation ship, they hope to find "the end" - or LED or NED
	- travelling carnival?
- notes
	- author surely discovered something here
