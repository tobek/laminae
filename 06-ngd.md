    > So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloudshadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that something is happening with you, that life has not forgotten you. You do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you.

<!--
the point:

- how to know what to move on from and when
- how to move on
- the joy of letting go
- ayy lmao, devastatingly meaningless and excruciatingly meaningful
-->

The rocky protrusions and overhangs of the Cicatrix are as gnarled and scarred as the Alters who reside there, dancing in tears and bliss on the knife edge between the devastating meaninglessness and excruciating meaningfulness of life. The Alters watch as the ship sinks, the race is won, the body enters the earth, the relationship is severed, and TODO(more poetic examples and distinguish from CND). They feel the joy and the pain of these moments, and they are present too when the pain and the joy are released moments or years later.

Alters appear to be more scar than being, and each bears this in their own way: with equanimity and absurdism, with joyful disregard, with violence and laughter. Their scars are their selves, twisted in directions both chosen and accepted. In eulogies of bloodletting and glossolalia and riddle the Alters paint, pierce, and scarify their bodies, and in these same rituals the landscape is marked too: memorialized with carvings, murals, and stelae until the rock is as transfigured as the Alters.

No "ground" roots the Cicatrix but instead the land winds with crags and plateaus giving way to tendrils of stone that protrude at all angles into the air and bridging distant land masses. The entire structure unpredictably rotates under a warm sun, a movement perceptible only on the order of many years. Graveyards eventually slip into the sky; full-grown trees hold on to ever more precarious precipices; and carvings, artifacts, and---challengingly---REF[apertures] are lost in far-fetched underhangs for aeons before becoming accessible again. A violent wind curls through the Cicatrix, which alongside the gradual rotation ensures that only the most enduring memorials survive, and even so, the surface is everywhere thick with them.

While Alters bear the REF[verging](verges) winds of catharsis across the multiverse, visitors are welcome to TODO

bring something you are done with or want to get rid of (or celebrate in a blaze of glory) and a ritual will be created around it, its essence split up and dispersed. Or maybe like a graveyard where everything is done appropriate justice, eulogized by incredible orators. Bloodletting. memorials are short-lived and will be lost to time

blissful, but the thing you are forced to let go of is rarely the thing you came to let go of.


- name
    + The Cicatrix (the scar of a healed wound e.g. on plant) <--
    + The Ligature
    + The Marrow
    + guess could be Lattice/Reticulum
- demonym
	+ Alters
	+ Ligands/Ligates
	+ Marrows
- quotes
	- "if you want something, don't ask for nothing. / if you want nothing, don't ask for something." - futureheads (NGD, CGD)
	- "Should you shield the canyon from the windstorm you would never see the intricacy of its carvings." ― Elisabeth Kübler-Ross NGP NGD CGD
- environment
	+ very very windy
	+ graveyards
	+ every surface scarred with carvings and stelae
	+ gravity is directly towards the nearly-unmoving sun, so apart from ledges and underhanging caves you don't get direct sunlight, but daylight floods the air and reflects from other land so yeah. but it rotates slowly
	+ the land itself bears wounds
	+ gravity - can you knock stuff off?
- culture
	- fuck your burn?
	- somewhat dangerous?
	- tattooed and weird petitioners?
	- kinda punk
	- speaking in riddles
	- laughter
	- ayy lmao
	- darkly absurdist
	- some petitioners seem more scar than being, but with good will, they are themselves, twisted in directions they chose or at least willingly leant into
	- how things heal tells you about the nature of the *present* of the thing (opposite of glitch thing)
	- TODO example ceremonies
		+ petitioner listens, you walk, it's beautiful
		+ solo time, dark night of the soul, it's beautiful
		+ purging
		+ bring something
			* burn it
			* sink it
			* eulogize it?
			* memorialize it
		+ bloodletting, scarification
		    * Some kind of bloodletting ceremony, maybe for summoning, their blood turns into something, after they have gone through some intense emotional experience or something - or leave summoning part for something else, and just regular bloodletting?
		+ like the Midsommar screaming one
		+ you put a construct on a pedestal and sing its praises and then smash it - graveyard of empty pedestals
			* maybe higher impact: you're in a makeshift room with the pedestal, and aftewards the walls are let down and you see all the other empty pedestals. and then you smash it?
- cardinal interaction
	- catharsis
	- they sometimes appear to mortals - in what form?
		+ the house burned down that relieved a burden, etc.
	- helping mortals move on
	- burdens are forgotten by getting sucked in here for brief commemoration
