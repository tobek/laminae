# Author's Preface

The twenty-seven laminae are unimaginably varied and vast, and all the superlatives of the multiverse lie within their folds. In the malignant wilderness of REF[CEC] there is a sheltered garden laboratory that holds a plant from which is brewed what must be the most spectacular tea TODO(tea is dumb?)[] known to conscious minds. On REF[LNC] original copies of each of the greatest architectural wonders of the multiverse crowd around the feet of the towering Scaffold, while on REF[CND] stands an Unraveller who holds simultaneously in her awareness each egg being cooked in that instant across all of reality. Buffeted by the primordial maelstrom of REF[CNC] endures the nautilus-shelled city of the Mutatorium in which you may reimagine yourself at will, or you might instead seek out the Universal Story of REF[NGC] and be transformed in ways impossible to foresee.

An ordinary mountain shows us what is possible to achieve with constructs of stone, and while the stone cottage we build cannot match the strength and size attained by mountains over geological ages, the cottage is better suited to our needs and can be married with other resources around us. As the mountain shows us what is possible with stone, so the REF[laminae]---boundless reservoirs of physical and notional forces---show us the shapes and possibilities of nature. On REF[cardinal] worlds we must contend with the intractable diversities of personality and culture, with all their resulting fruits and labors, but the laminae shape their inhabitants towards concentrated philosophical extremes, and so are able to reach baffling heights and alarming depths only attainable with aeons of unified effort.

To such places I am a visitor and will remain a visitor, as would you be should you follow in this visitor's footsteps. In our cardinal realities however we are not visitors, and with our stones and seeds and cultures must build lives for ourselves and each other. We would do well to understand laminal forces, for in each lamina the seeds of human psyches and building blocks of reality play out to myriad conclusions, but we should not aim to emulate them literally; rather we should draw from them what we need.

Over decades of travel and residence on the twenty-seven laminae this visitor found little of what she initially sought, but let go of much, and can only hope that the knowledge and perspective gathered in this work provide some avenue of interchange between the laminal and the cardinal, between realms of the abstract possible and the lives we share with our kin.

You may forgive this visitor any ignorance or provincial incredulity that reveals itself in the following text. It is not intentional, but we all carry our stories with us. One must attempt to be generous in understanding the nature of drastically different states of mind. May you reach compassion and even insight in the face of the alien and fantastic modes of being in these pages.
