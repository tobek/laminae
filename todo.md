# big questions

- facets
- include conduit?
- dissimulation
- setting
    + part of our world? tenuously, compatible
    + is there any benefit to using fantasy races? elves etc. maybe not.
        * removed mentions of "human" in guild note
        * various mentions in Unfolding feud
        * lgd bookeepers "race"
        * searched "human" and "race" and accounted for all
- how do the pictures fit into the frame? unexplained? or are they paintings by the author?

# big ideas

- branch out with allusions
    + pick an oulipo process and a myth or concept and see where they go

# misc before launch

- favicon!
    + something from diagram inspo? maybe "Folio from 'Kitab..." or compass rose from "Piri_Reis..."
- lamina
    + ASK:
        * Hey I'm surveying people to get a read on something... How would you think to pronounce the word "laminae" as in the title "Observations on the Twenty-Seven Laminae"? Don't look anything up (at least not first). Also, what meanings/associations does the word have for you?
    + laminae is actually pronounced "la-mi-nai" (~US) or "la-mi-nee" (~UK)
    + just hate "la-mi-nay"
    + latin rule is that words ending in "a" are made plural to "ae" (antenna, formula, nebula). lamina is latin singular. but if i invent a word laminum, the plural ending would be lamina (laminus should be lamini? but whatevs)
        * https://www.dailywritingtips.com/latin-plural-endings/
- twitter?
    + thread header: brief description and the alignments
    + backdating some already-completed chapters
    + The Moilers of the Instrument (Hierarchy, Utility, Destruction) live in the interior of a colossal machine (outside has never been seen) which they maintain, but their culture has lost its knowledge of the purpose of the machine and its operation and as a result have devolved into blah blah mission they can't fulfill
- should "guide" heading be moved and everything promoted?
    + check if anything is actually under guide
- finalize copyright stance
- "ready" in each lamina section and task
    + each needs
        * for overview/viz: name, demonym, summary
        * for page itself: reuse summary (or longer abstract) and enticing table of contents
        * don't worry about things changing form later
    + go through index.yml and all.md side by side
    + pick one, go deeper!
- more narrator stuff
- cosmology viz
- feedback
    + i'm interested in primarily in:
        * things that take you OUT of the flow of reading, whether that's grammatical/stylistic (something is hard to follow) or something in the world doesn't make sense ("wait, why would they do that that doesn't make sense")
        * also interested in what DOES work for you, things that stand out that you like
        * which parts are boring/you want to hear less about, and which parts you're curious to hear more about
- email - mid april or may?
    + BCC "a few of you said you were interested in an update along the way..." maybe March or April share something
        * christen, dan

# misc after launch

    + IJ subreddit to say i put an homage to IJ in here
    + mechanical monk twitter about that "build spaces like this" beautiful tweet

# Sections

## ●◍◍○ Frame

## ●◍◍○ Primer

## ◍○○○ Preface

you should be intrigued on the first read, and if you read it again after reading the whole work it should be really powerful

## ●◍◍○ Cosmography

decided = 3, written = 4.

contents:

- what's the ordial plane?
    + my answer: it's the imagination
    + don't talk about it as if it's a big deal
- basic mechanics: transport (between, and to/from), etc
- terminology

- major q's
    + afterlife?
    + geography
    + relation to our world
    + how you get there, portals etc. would be weird if author didn't mention, but if author does, does that give the guild hints on where to start?
        * can just talk about apertures but not mention where?

### general stuff

- general setup of afterlife/petitioners, is that helpful or should these just be places?
- geographic layout - none for now. they're just layers overlapping each other
- ordial plane is boundary/connection between these planes and normal ones
    + https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6qd9e6/the_ordial_plane_the_plane_of_proof/
    + maybe no discussion of ordial plane, like "everyone knows what that is"
- no gods. they find the alignments of the realm too overpowering and opinionated - the greatest power on each plane is the alignment. of course, demigods and powerful beings are around, but too powerful and they leave. maybe each plane has a core/heart/nexus that matches alignment? all in very different forms - landscape, artifact, building, being (maybe the collective), furniture, work of art. maybe that's where shunts are?

### terms

- find/replace
    + realm/plane/planar - ?
    + portal/gate
    + prime
    + outsider
    + probably search world and realm and mortal to make sure they make sense
- name for this all? the twenty-seven lamina(e)
- LAMINA
    - lamina/laminae or laminum/lamina or laminus/lamina or laminon/lamina
    - example sentences
        + Observations on the Twenty-Seven ____
        + Overview of the ____
        + For every instant in time, this ____ contains one complete copy of reality...
        + Training foreign teams visiting from outside the ____
        + Axial is regarded as the "center" of the ____---inasmuch as an infinite ocean can have a center
        + more hospitable to visitors than many ____s
        + this results in a large foreign contingent on the ____
        + Scholarly Unravellers will assert that this ____ is responsible for the passage of time itself
        + relating only that they rarely venture out from this ____ but, when they do, it's rather exciting
    - no
        + facet (for alignments)
        + membrane
        + scape
        + lamella (a thin layer, membrane, or plate of tissue, especially in bone)
        + strata
        + sheath
        + manifold
- apertures
- "plane" - use anywhere other than Ordial Plane? no - use realm, world, land, domain
- word for non-lamina
    + mortal worlds/lands/realms
    + extralaminar
    + cardinal?
- denizens
    + petitioner (aka souls)
    + mortals AKA temporals
        * two types:
            - cardinals/outsiders
            - born and bred here, immigrants?
    + laminals
        * LNC windshifters, LGD bookkeepers, others

### geography brainstorm

goals:

- easy to grok and imagine
    + easy to grok and imagine relationships/alignment layout
    + and also their cosmic place in reality
- "cool", "wow", "huh"
- as few fudges as possible - and fudges should be clean

i think i'm drawn towards no contiguous geography cause that's what i started with and it's easier?

corners (3 extremes) have 3 borders, edges (2 extremes) have 4 borders, face centers (1 extreme) have 5

can you walk from heaven to hell? no. but like river styx leads to hades - maybe instead of portals there are like passageways and tunnels, or some places do have borderlands?

the gate surface tension thing - does that really matter? none of these planes yet are TOTALLY hostile

might not need elemental planes - no prob not

**contiguous geography pros**

- no need for gates
    + but still need gates to GET there, unless it's all petitioners (which it's not)
- potentially cool big landscape
- easier to grok?
- potentially cool border lands
    + LNC - LNP, NNC, LGC, LEC - all cool
    + CNP - CND, CNC, ~NNP~, CGP, CEP
    + CEC - CEP, NEP, CNC
- potentially cool relationships, especially between C, P, and D versions of same alignment
- cool mountain peaks for C planes and abyss drop-offs for D planes
    + LNC glass ocean i guess flows from NNC into some huge plateau or else it must travel maybe a river through LNP and maybe LND
    + LGD pavilions could be cliff-edge
    + CND could drop through
    + LEC could have panopticons from their peaks (could do this anyway but magically)

**contiguous geography cons**

- is it less... pure? it's more normal
- borders = more stuff to write/figure out
- none of the P or D planes with any N can get to NNP or NND unless some weird underground thing
    + that's okay, they're weird planes
- some hard border lands?
    + went through all, no dealbreakers
    + NND is fine, NNP i guess also
    + LNC surrounded by ocean
        * architects transit across?
        * flat platuea?
    + some (only LNP so far? maybe CNC, maybe LEC) don't have ground sky - it's all ground
        * CNC and LEC could both be underground
    + the crevasse - could just be a wall or mountain range around the whole thing, OR there is actually a top
        * the wall could be a D plane, no "other side" stuff
    + CEC is flat too? guess it could be a gentle slope
    + other possible as-yet-unused challenges: space habitat, underwater
- where do the absolute planes go?
    + could get rid of them, just discussing the "pure" force
    + the nautilus and outpost could be in places like CNC where the fabric is thin

**discontinuous geography pros**

- don't have to figure out borders
- clean?
- i like the idea that every prime plane is potentially connected to all 27, that they're all kind of layered over all reality, that they are everywhere and nowhere, which doesn't fit as well with the contiguous landscape
- doesn't *have* to be a place. these are like physical forces

**discontinuous geography cons**

- have to have portals or something
- easy to grok concept (with 3d cube) but maybe harder to grok... layout

## ◍◍○○ Facets

decided = 2, written = 3, revised = 4

**markup for attaching glyphs to facets**

    The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory ... that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. ... "Ideas" or "Forms" are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato ... sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge.

    "problem of universals" - "Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals [being human, red, big, liquid, circular], but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech" or are simply mental artifacts

hierarchy (synthesis) autonomy - how to organize, allocate power
empathy (utility) power - what to organize for, value system, how to determine what is an acceptable means
creation (preservation) dissolution - the means

- change from D&D alignments
    + noun vs adj
        * example sentences/placements
        * try a few out
            - hierarchical empathic creation
            - hierarchy empthy creation
            - hierarchical ambitious destruction
            - autonomous empathic destruction
            - autonomous ambitious preservation (CEP)
            - autonomy, ambition, and preservation
        * "A and B and C" vs "A B C" vs "A, B, C"
    + goals
        * each can be viewed in a wholly positive light
        * one can be sacrificed for the other
    + narrow word options, move rest into "related" nest
    + swap good & evil or law & chaos so that they line up
    + counter examples
    + think about what each side accuses the other of
    + pick one and review laminae
- a name for each axis
    + like the control axis for order/chaos, the cyclic axis for create/destroy? good/evil is moral or ethical axis, or is ethical order/chaos?
    + good/evil is definitely moral - value system according to community etc, right and wrong
    + order/chaos is kind of ethics (a personal code of conduct? practical set of rules for people to follow?) but less clear cut, ethics feels important to good/evil too
    + hierarchy/synthsesis/autonomy
        * control
        * agency
    + empathy/utility/power
        * motivation
        * motive
        * incentive
    + creation/equiliibrium/dissipation
        * means
        * force
        * cause?
        * origin?
- name for each and all
    + facets
    + absolutes
    + factors
- name for axis
    + axis
- maybe the related terms are all given in dichotomies
- finalize glyphs

> "You only go to the wrong place if you fail at your alignment." Thus, an evil person who performs good acts is sent to, for example, Celestia, and suffers there. A good character who murders is sent to one of the lower planes and suffers there. But an evil person who murders is sent to a plane matching his/her alignment and fits right in.
> in 3.5 there is a divine source above the gods that notes whether one is good or evil, because of the presence of "Detect Good" and "Detect Evil." If the gods actually powered the spells it would be "Detect Believer" and "Detect opposing philosophies" as most competent old-time religions define evil as "Not us."
> If the character is punished only by evidence of her acts, in a relativistic system, then use a reputation system as the basis. If the character is punished by beard-in-sky, then keep a rap-sheet of her actions, with beard-in-sky acting on the rap-sheet in any way the setting deems fit.

so what's the process by which a petitioner goes to a lamina? i don't think it should be some magical rap-sheet building up over time and your actions are weighed by some beard in the sky. there is no punishment or reward, it's more: where are you most suited to. the rap-sheet is YOU, how your world and actions have shaped you. after a lifetime of hard work fitting your nature and circumstances into the world around you, you go somewhere where you tendencies are pleasantly utilized. how? TODO(better example) if you roll an object over a surface with carefully cut slots in it, the object will fall through only the slot that fits. does this mean that every soul has a true "shape" - what about non-self... maybe more like reincarnation in a fitting role

maybe some, or even most, souls don't go to lamina, but fall through cracks and go nowhere, or maybe reincarnated for another go round? eh

what is "neutral"? needed?

- Just / Arbitrary
- Merciful / Cruel
- Modest / Proud
- Pious / Worldly

ultima: Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility

four-philosophy ensemble: cynic, optimist, realist, apathetic/conflicted

> 'Open Palm' versus 'Closed Fist'. Open Palm stands for harmony, accepting one's position in life and helping others accept theirs by supporting them, while Closed Fist stands for chaos, seeking to rise above one's station and encouraging others to do the same by teaching them self-sufficiency, harshly if necessary

idealism vs cynicism/paragon vs renegade

Beleaguered Good, Chaotic Greedy, Foolish Good, Arrogant Neutral, Selfish Evil, and Lawful Bland.

puritan vs. radical - methods used *while* doing good or evil

passive, self-seeking, and inwardly-focused (Aka), aggressive, others-centered, and outwardly-focused (Coar), or a balance between those extremes (Zinatt).

torment: tides of numenera:

- *Blue Tide*: Represents wisdom, enlightenment, and mysticism. It is the Tide of people whose goal is to expand the mind and the spirit.
- *Red Tide*: Represents passion, emotion, action, and zeal. It is the Tide of people whose goal is to live in the moment, to experience life to its fullest, or to follow their heart wherever it leads them.
- *Indigo Tide*: Represents justice, compromise, and the greater good. It is the Tide of people who view life's difficulties from a broad, global perspective rather than an individual one.
- *Gold Tide*: Represents charity, sacrifice, and empathy. It is the Tide of people whose primary goal is to help others, especially at a cost to themselves.
- *Silver Tide*: Represents admiration of power and seekers of fame. It is the Tide of people who seek to influence the lives of others or who actively seek to be remembered.

"The Tides are linked to action, not intention."

fit this in somewhere - is this some CG pole? "A specific subset of self-expression values—emancipative values—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal autonomy and the voice of the people."

### Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic

this is about control? in lawful, members are subject to control by others and/or exert control over others... though can also be internal? although we're thinking good/evil is about power/security...

> On the left side of the grid would be the extreme of needing lots of control, either on the internal (civilization, laws, rules, expectations) or internal (code of honor, rules of behavior, shame, guilt).
> In the middle of the grid are those who think rules can be helpful but have seen too much abuse of the rules. They will work with good rules and outright break bad ones.
> As one progresses to the right side of the grid, the need for control lessens until the character is loath to accept any form of control, either external or internal.

honor... can't you be chaotic and honorable? is that neutral? if we define chaos as dishonorable then we're making it closer to evil. tradition/invention and communal/individual are better

don't confuse "law" with lacking creativity, more about the channels in which ideas flow. there is more freedom in blah, but the constraints of systems can produce creativity

where do strange loops fit in? a middle thing? relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. this could be a plot device

- name
    + auth/liber compass calls this the social axis
    + i think d&d calls this the ethics axis
- HIERARCHY VS AUTONOMY
- Law vs freedom
- Authority vs liberty
- Communalism vs individualism/independence
- Tradition vs invention
- tradition vs. secular-rationality?
    + "Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook."
    + "Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable."
    + "People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their sense of existential security increases" (this suggests evil -> good brings about law -> chaos)
- where does "agency" fit into this?
    + on the one hand chaos feels like more agency, but also i can imagine LG with lots of agency
    + i guess with L, agency depends on your position in the hierarchy
- disgust/purity vs. openness
- control vs. liberty
- autonomy does NOT mean lack of accountability. in fact autonomists would argue that hierarchy shields people from accountability, by appeals to authority as justification for their actions
- law
    + hierarchy
    + systematic?
    + archy (arkhy)
    + most generous: communitarian? i guess good law is this, evil law is hierarchy and control)
    + organization/mobilization?
    + structure
    + tradition
    + order
    + discipline
    + justice
    + principle
    + honor
    + related:
        * integrity (though autonomy lays claim to this)
        * judgment
        * conformity
        * stability
        * predictability
- neutral
    + utility
    + pragmatism
    + practical
    + balance
    + focus
    + realism
    + harmony
    + equilibrium
- chaos
    + autonomy
    + invention
    + freedom
    + independence
    + related:
        * individualism
        * radical
        * disorder
        * dynamism
        * change

chaos accuses law of being close-minded, obedient, and sometimes evil? corrupt? lacking self respect
law accuses chaos of being evil? corrupt? immoral, unprincipled, reckless, mercenary. lacking self respect. they each accuse each other of being untrustworthy and untrusting: auto thinks hier needs hier since they can't trust each other, and hier thinks auto aren't trustworthy enough to hold their end up in a system

both see their own vision as one of integrity and honor

### Good, Neutral, Evil

is this about feelings towards other beings and also nature?

power - the belief that nature has distributed its goods unevenly and that efforts to deny that will backfire. advancement on all levels occurs when individuals work as hard as possible to advance their and their communities' interests, and that the tension arising when individuals and communities' advancements come at the expense of others only pushes people to exceed more and result in a great overall advancement

what about someone who has great empathy for their in group, but don't give a shit about out group? maybe those are neutral - the extreme good has some kind of universalism. actually the law/chaos axis contributes to in-group. law means in-group is at minimum their tribe, chaos means in-group is at minimum themselves. so yeah "empathy" absolute is universal, even for out-group.

tolerance of outsiders vs. tribalism. but this also seems related to law/chaos axis? no. LG is tolerant, LE is not. CG is tolerant, CE basically doesn't matter

do you exploit weakness, in order to purge weakness, or accommdate it?

- name
    + political compass left/right calls this economic
    + d&d calls it moral?
- POWER VS EMPATHY
- survival vs. self-expression? power is about survival
    + "Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance." "priority of security over liberty"
    + "Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life."
    + "People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their sense of individual agency increases"
        * this suggests... some relationship with law/chaos axis
- it is linked to economic: power says things should be "left to the devices of competing individuals and organizations"
- tough vs tender
- is good more utopian or optimistic, evil more cynical?
- empathy
    + compassion
    + humane
    + altruism
    + universalism
    + peace
    + equity
    + compromise
    + idealism
    + universality
- neutral
    + balance
    + rationality
    + pragmatism
    + focus
    + realism
    + utility
- power
    + notes
        * power is a good word cause it also means like competence, capacity, strength, but also control and dominance (leaning into hierarchy... well no, hierarchy is only one way of doing it; hierarchy can structure empathy too)
    + ambition
    + appetite
    + determination
    + achievement
    + aggression
    + force
    + security
    + success
    + luxury
    + cynicism (sees itself as realism)

power accuses empathy of being passive, weak, dependent on others
empathy accuses power of being evil, selfish

### Creation, Preservation, Destruction

destruction is scary, and powerful, but not evil in the slightest, and is perfectly necessary

- creation
    + creativity
- preservation
    + maintenance
    + perpetuation
    + persistence
    + *equilibrium*
    + observation?
    + prob not
        * harmony
        * regeneration
        * renewal
- destruction
    + *dissolution*

### Glyphs

data-facet= and pseudo after content

- (labeled) glyph square on trinym hover?
    + like above and below are the other facets from that axis, dimmed, with text and glyph
    + to the sides are the other axes
- triggered based on some class that can be added manually but is automatically added from REF whitelist of facets
- glyphs on title page? maye ၜ for "overview of the laminae"

## ○○○○ Close

- is this necessary?
- if not, CEC or absolutes/facets would be last sequential thing, could maybe swing it
- revisit parrigues ending
- how come the work is basically done? maybe here she lists the things she didn't do
- or she allows herself

## ◍◍○○ Glossary/Index

- define in glossary file/chapter using reference markup
- find all for term and then add REF markup - maybe only first per chapter (or section?)
- process along with references

so far (some need changing, decide/find and replace):

- in cosmography chapter
    + petitioner
    + outsider (check if used anyway)
    + mortal
    + portal? (gateway?)
    + prime/prime world
    + planar?
    + extraplanar? like 6 mentions in LNC alone
    + plane/lamina
    + soblei
- places? (cerivalia, anywhere else?)
- races/creatures? (eladrin, balors, etc)
- alignment/"force"?
    + "the force of destruction"

## ◍○○○ Colophon

Same as "about"?

ask on myanmar/burma/burmese subreddit about this. maybe incorporate some burmese myth into narrator, explain language

- Thank you to the [Burmese culture](link) for having developed my favorite [script](link) which has been used for beautiful symbols throughout this project.
    + maybe mention my connection and personal feelings
    + See more examples [here](link)
    + Learn more about TODO.
    + Support TODO.
    + Recommended book
    + Also Burmese food is incredible: check out [TODO](link) in San Francisco and [TODO](link) in NYC.
- also mention other indic scripts?

# Tasks

## ■▤▤ Build

- process (remove # from file name?? maybe not)
- opengraph etc

### clean

- change spell check to english (make sure to preserve added words)
- check/clean
    + spellcheck
    + check all " - " (probably replace all with "---")
    + "  " (double space)
- check for english spelling
- go through all the macros
- remove comments

## ■▤□ Title

- figure out TOC format
- probably change order to all hierarchy first, etc.
- probably figure out way to build it rather than type it fuckin out

goals:

- immediately enticing
- looks like a full world with lots to dive into it
- the basic structure is either understandable, or understandable enough that it's clear that there *is* a structure
- each lamina can be skimmed for interest and flavor and mystery such that reader can see the breadth of things and dive in as desired

viz:

- content for each:
    + alignment (english and glyphs)
    + demonym
    + name
    + summary
        * `abstract` (1-3 paragraphs) *can* work for overview page, but if necessary make new small `summary` that is like 2-3 sentences
    + pic(s)?
- generate from YML (maybe gather some stuff from scanning pages?)
    + `import yaml`
    + `with open (r'index.yml') as file:`
        * `index = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)`
    + `import pprint; pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=2).pprint(index)`

## ■□□ Styles

- *figure out chapter heading (demonym, alignment)*
- *line spacing on title lamina*
- *try baskerville*
    + google "baskerville specimen"
    + http://marikoproduct.com/Typography
- with leise:
    + ordering of laminae by facets
    + fonts
    + hr's
    + h's (h3's look wrong, h4's like in CND language...)
    + line and paragraph spacing - possible to make like manuscript?
    + title page
        * small caps anywhere?
    + drop caps? decorated initials (historiated/illuminated initial)
        * go one heading level deeper?
        * Lombardic/rubricated capitals every paragraph?
    + navigation links
        * small caps? but then should front TOC - and chapter TOC - be small caps?
    + contents OVERVIEW OF THE PLANES - should it be under next section, what
    + intro quotes
    + ask about capitalization
- confirm all indic fonts
    + make sure nested bullets work
    + maybe update font(s) to just have needed symbols
    + choose burmese font (from `/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSansMyanmar*`)
        * compare on different browsers
- mobile and browser compatibility check
    + styles, fonts, what else?
- later
    + footnotes/hash fragment links should highlight word (and maybe paragraph)
        * maybe like some scroll curlicue drawn around it or to the side
        * or a glow

### code tasks

- visited links should be more noticeable
- "about" in bottom right is crowded on mobile
- later
    + change mobile nav bar color
    + full screen?

## ■□□ Author

2 = fleshed out backstory and voice
3 = lotsa content - is that it?

- burmese connection? some burmese myth of a writer?
- decide on "visitor" or whatever
- parrigues

## ▤□□ Visualization

places where viz would make sense:

- TOC
    + between heading and items
    + hover over in one highlights in the other
- overview
    + can remove if TOC nails it
- cosmography

same in all? remove one or two of these?

formats:

- 3 squares of 9 cards each
    + each card shows glyphs, english facets, name, and brief description?
    + this could be Overview page
- could be 3 wheels? though the square grid is easier to grok
- exploding 3d cube
    + card view as above on hover
    + compass rose in corner
    + list of facets too?
    + hovering over glyph/facet highlights all its laminae and mentions elsewhere

so maybe 2 formats, can switch between, and the pretty one shown by default on TOC and grokkier one on cosmography

## ■□□ Plates

- lightbox?
- credit visible on hover?
- captions? i think maybe not
- float, or only full width?
- multi-image ones?
- style matching
    + .9 opacity on all? maybe makes them too pale. transparency vignette? filter?
- photoshop
    + "Michael Hutter - Carcosa XXXIV" remove buildings
    + "Floto+Warner - Colourant - orange" eh
    + CEC henry hudson meld images?
    + CEC nausicaa remove person/look at other frames from movie, animated?
- mood board with all the images? per-lamina mood boards for some? at the bottom

### implementation

following discarded:

    MEDIA(some pic about something)

this gets used (no double quotes allowed):

    MEDIA("pic-name.jpg")

## ▤□□ References

handle translated refs! (what does this mean?)

Source/main reference is EITHER an h# element with id, or a `<dfn>` element with `id` attr showing up anywhere. Contents of node is the term being defined, or the `title` attribute can be it. Definition is the wrapping element or `def` attribute. Id is its or parents `id`.

Should have an optional actual definition string that can be shown in tooltip, and "go to [page title]" link if same page, otherwise "go to text" if on same page?

References themselves just link <a> tags for now (maybe should be <abbrv> or <dl>)

    REF[text](id)
    REF[The Wilt](CNP)
    REF[____[the Concordance]](LGP)
    REF[TODO(artist plane)[the Bauble]](NEC)
    REF[Galabast](galabast)
    REF[Galabast] # default id is lowercased string TODO not implemented
    REF[Blighted lovers](CNP#the-lovers)
    REF[wind shifters](LNC#wind-shifters)
    REF[Equilibrium](facets#equilibrium)
    REF[Equilibrium] # whitelist dict of terms to auto-map TODO not implemented

process all `<dfn>`s and all headings to find IDs and which pages they're on.

- parse
    + parse each file
    + get its ID, title, and filename
        * also get its short description, since these are definitions too
    + get each dfn and element with id
        * exclude the basic headings
- insert
    + get all `a.ref`'s
    + if it starts with "#" done
    + find the actual ref
    + if none, do "hasn't been translated yet", remove href and/or update class
    + if yes, update href with filename

same-page REFs link as normal. if not found, look for page ID transform

ok we need more processing to get full link and hover text

- gloss is just a ref to something in the glossary
- A-Z index of all of them, each showing chapter as source
    + bold the one with definition
    + how to show multiple references on same page? i guess don't
- don't do separate page for each item, each lives somewhere
- should you be able to hover for quick description? for glossary items definitely yes, maybe heading/dfn can define a summary, or we can pull it out somehow (see dfn spec) and parse those
- map from ID (in md frontmatter) to filename

floating TOC?

## ▤▤□ Gondola Owl


## □□□ Calligraphy


## □□□ Peristalsis

- any other interactivity? any procedurally generated stuff?
    + maybe some sub-projects, like gondola owl could be somewhere
    + calligraphic thing?
    + "list of plates" kind of thing could list them all
