# big questions

- how can it support scifi? should it? why wouldn't it?
    + maybe it is totally out of time and some scifi stuff is present, but author doesn't have terminology to describe it (like the instrument)
- meaning behind effects
    + guild terms/burmese/unfinished titles changing
    + image changing (just NGP so far)
    + AI-generated text
- how do the pictures fit into the frame? unexplained? or are they paintings by the author?
- include conduit?
- language??
    + can petitioners and mortals understand each other? handwave something? how to petitioners from different worlds understand each other??
    + planescape it's just celestial/infernal etc?
- setting
    + part of our world? tenuously, compatible
    + is there any benefit to using fantasy races? elves etc. maybe not.
        * removed mentions of "human" in guild note

# misc after launch

- feedback
    + i'm interested in primarily in:
        * things that take you OUT of the flow of reading, whether that's grammatical/stylistic (something is hard to follow) or something in the world doesn't make sense ("wait, why would they do that that doesn't make sense")
        * also interested in what DOES work for you, things that stand out that you like
        * which parts are boring/you want to hear less about, and which parts you're curious to hear more about

# Sections

## ●◍◍◍ Frame

## ●◍◍○ Primer

## ●◍◍○ Preface

you should be intrigued on the first read, and if you read it again after reading the whole work it should be really powerful

## ●◍◍○ Cosmography

should ordial primer link to laminae and glossary terms?

one more edit pass = 4

contents:

- what's the ordial plane?
    + my answer: it's the imagination
    + don't talk about it as if it's a big deal
- basic mechanics: transport (between, and to/from), etc
- terminology

- major q's
    + afterlife?
    + geography
    + relation to our world
    + how you get there, portals etc. would be weird if author didn't mention, but if author does, does that give the guild hints on where to start?
        * can just talk about apertures but not mention where?
- lamina name
    + ASK:
        * Hey I'm surveying people to get a read on something... How would you think to pronounce the word "laminae" as in the title "Observations on the Twenty-Seven Laminae"? Don't look anything up (at least not first). Also, what meanings/associations does the word have for you?
    + laminae is actually pronounced "la-mi-nai" (~US) or "la-mi-nee" (~UK)
    + just hate "la-mi-nay"
    + latin rule is that words ending in "a" are made plural to "ae" (antenna, formula, nebula). lamina is latin singular. but if i invent a word laminum, the plural ending would be lamina (laminus should be lamini? but whatevs)
        * https://www.dailywritingtips.com/latin-plural-endings/

### general stuff

- general setup of afterlife/petitioners, is that helpful or should these just be places?
- geographic layout - none for now. they're just layers overlapping each other
- ordial plane is boundary/connection between these planes and normal ones
    + https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6qd9e6/the_ordial_plane_the_plane_of_proof/
    + maybe no discussion of ordial plane, like "everyone knows what that is"
- no gods. they find the alignments of the realm too overpowering and opinionated - the greatest power on each plane is the alignment. of course, demigods and powerful beings are around, but too powerful and they leave. maybe each plane has a core/heart/nexus that matches alignment? all in very different forms - landscape, artifact, building, being (maybe the collective), furniture, work of art. maybe that's where shunts are?

### terms

- find/replace
    + realm/plane/planar - ?
    + portal/gate
    + prime
    + outsider
    + probably search world and realm and mortal to make sure they make sense
- name for this all? the twenty-seven lamina(e)
- LAMINA
    - lamina/laminae or laminum/lamina or laminus/lamina (eh no laminus)
    - example sentences
        + Observations on the Twenty-Seven ____
        + Overview of the ____
        + For every instant in time, this ____ contains one complete copy of reality...
        + Training foreign teams visiting from outside the ____
        + Axial is regarded as the "center" of the ____---inasmuch as an infinite ocean can have a center
        + more hospitable to visitors than many ____s
        + this results in a large foreign contingent on the ____
        + Scholarly Unravellers will assert that this ____ is responsible for the passage of time itself
        + relating only that they rarely venture out from this ____ but, when they do, it's rather exciting
    - no
        + facet (for alignments)
        + membrane
        + scape
        + lamella (a thin layer, membrane, or plate of tissue, especially in bone)
        + strata
        + sheath
        + manifold
- apertures (gate, portal)
- "plane" - use anywhere other than Ordial Plane? no - use realm, world, land, domain
- word for non-lamina
    + mortal worlds/lands/realms
    + extralaminar
    + cardinal?
- denizens
    + petitioner (aka souls)
    + mortals AKA temporals
        * two types:
            - cardinals/outsiders
            - born and bred here, immigrants?
    + laminals
        * LNC windshifters, LGD bookkeepers, others

### geography brainstorm

goals:

- easy to grok and imagine
    + easy to grok and imagine relationships/alignment layout
    + and also their cosmic place in reality
- "cool", "wow", "huh"
- as few fudges as possible - and fudges should be clean

i think i'm drawn towards no contiguous geography cause that's what i started with and it's easier?

corners (3 extremes) have 3 borders, edges (2 extremes) have 4 borders, face centers (1 extreme) have 5

can you walk from heaven to hell? no. but like river styx leads to hades - maybe instead of portals there are like passageways and tunnels, or some places do have borderlands?

the gate surface tension thing - does that really matter? none of these planes yet are TOTALLY hostile

might not need elemental planes - no prob not

**contiguous geography pros**

- no need for gates
    + but still need gates to GET there, unless it's all petitioners (which it's not)
- potentially cool big landscape
- easier to grok?
- potentially cool border lands
    + LNC - LNP, NNC, LGC, LEC - all cool
    + CNP - CND, CNC, ~NNP~, CGP, CEP
    + CEC - CEP, NEP, CNC
- potentially cool relationships, especially between C, P, and D versions of same alignment
- cool mountain peaks for C planes and abyss drop-offs for D planes
    + LNC glass ocean i guess flows from NNC into some huge plateau or else it must travel maybe a river through LNP and maybe LND
    + LGD pavilions could be cliff-edge
    + CND could drop through
    + LEC could have panopticons from their peaks (could do this anyway but magically)

**contiguous geography cons**

- is it less... pure? it's more normal
- borders = more stuff to write/figure out
- none of the P or D planes with any N can get to NNP or NND unless some weird underground thing
    + that's okay, they're weird planes
- some hard border lands?
    + went through all, no dealbreakers
    + NND is fine, NNP i guess also
    + LNC surrounded by ocean
        * architects transit across?
        * flat platuea?
    + some (only LNP so far? maybe CNC, maybe LEC) don't have ground sky - it's all ground
        * CNC and LEC could both be underground
    + the crevasse - could just be a wall or mountain range around the whole thing, OR there is actually a top
        * the wall could be a D plane, no "other side" stuff
    + CEC is flat too? guess it could be a gentle slope
    + other possible as-yet-unused challenges: space habitat, underwater
- where do the absolute planes go?
    + could get rid of them, just discussing the "pure" force
    + the nautilus and outpost could be in places like CNC where the fabric is thin

**discontinuous geography pros**

- don't have to figure out borders
- clean?
- i like the idea that every prime plane is potentially connected to all 27, that they're all kind of layered over all reality, that they are everywhere and nowhere, which doesn't fit as well with the contiguous landscape
- doesn't *have* to be a place. these are like physical forces

**discontinuous geography cons**

- have to have portals or something
- easy to grok concept (with 3d cube) but maybe harder to grok... layout

## ●◍◍○ Facets

FINALIZE GLYPHS - just about done!

complete draft = 3 + ready, revised = 4

    The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory ... that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. ... "Ideas" or "Forms" are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato ... sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge.

    "problem of universals" - "Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals [being human, red, big, liquid, circular], but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech" or are simply mental artifacts

- do "paired with" for all facets?
- list "tends to" in pros and cons?
- noun vs adj: noun, "A, B, C"
- goals
    + each can be viewed in a wholly positive light
    + one can be sacrificed for the other
- a name for each axis
    + hierarchy/synthesis/autonomy
        * method
        * control
        * agency
    + empathy/utility/power
        * motive
        * moral
        * incentive
    + creation/equiliibrium/dissipation
        * means
        * force
        * cause?
        * origin?
        * cycle
- name for each and all
    + facets
    + absolutes
- name for axis
    + axis
- maybe the related terms are all given in dichotomies
- finalize glyphs
- relationship between method axis and motive axis
    + tradition vs. secular-rationality?
        * "Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook."
        * "Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable."
        * "People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their sense of existential security increases" (this suggests evil -> good brings about law -> chaos)
    + survival vs. self-expression? power is about survival
        * "Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance." "priority of security over liberty"
        * "Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life."
        * "People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their sense of individual agency increases"
            - this suggests... some relationship with law/chaos axis
    + is this some CG pole? "A specific subset of self-expression values—emancipative values—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal autonomy and the voice of the people."

> "You only go to the wrong place if you fail at your alignment." Thus, an evil person who performs good acts is sent to, for example, Celestia, and suffers there. A good character who murders is sent to one of the lower planes and suffers there. But an evil person who murders is sent to a plane matching his/her alignment and fits right in.
> in 3.5 there is a divine source above the gods that notes whether one is good or evil, because of the presence of "Detect Good" and "Detect Evil." If the gods actually powered the spells it would be "Detect Believer" and "Detect opposing philosophies" as most competent old-time religions define evil as "Not us."
> If the character is punished only by evidence of her acts, in a relativistic system, then use a reputation system as the basis. If the character is punished by beard-in-sky, then keep a rap-sheet of her actions, with beard-in-sky acting on the rap-sheet in any way the setting deems fit.

so what's the process by which a petitioner goes to a lamina? i don't think it should be some magical rap-sheet building up over time and your actions are weighed by some beard in the sky. there is no punishment or reward, it's more: where are you most suited to. the rap-sheet is YOU, how your world and actions have shaped you. after a lifetime of hard work fitting your nature and circumstances into the world around you, you go somewhere where you tendencies are pleasantly utilized. how? TODO(better example) if you roll an object over a surface with carefully cut slots in it, the object will fall through only the slot that fits. does this mean that every soul has a true "shape" - what about non-self... maybe more like reincarnation in a fitting role

maybe some, or even most, souls don't go to lamina, but fall through cracks and go nowhere, or maybe reincarnated for another go round? eh

## ◍○○○ Close

- maybe the only first person is in preface and close (why? intimate, after the fact?)
- revisit parrigues ending
- how come the work is basically done? maybe here she lists the things she didn't do
- or she allows herself (?)
- more hints about the "real" nature (is it all made up? i forget)
- imply that some of reader's experiences have actually been on laminae
- maybe translator note about it being different - weaker handwriting (too easy), different paper and ink, etc.
- some untranslateable bits
- emploring reader to some kind of action or change
- some personal author bits too, now is the time to drive it home
- kind of an open universe call (some contributions already from readers like you?)
- oh definitely "if you should see this visitor" (but 1st person?) then xyz - sad cause, yknow
- analogies again like the preface
- evoking sense of wonder, that's the purpose of this whole piece, now apply it to your world
- really punchy beginning and end, chills

I have carried these Observations with me for a long time, hoping to share etc etc

Reader, do you feel as if you, too, are a visitor?

Reader, it is likely that you, too, have been a visitor on the laminae.

Recall a time when nature wobbled, when you entered a place where the air shone.

Our world is full of the fruits of the laminae.

What would you place/root on these laminae? What works of LEC beauty have you sighted through the thin veil of the Ordial, that one piece in the gallery that was unlike all the others? What structures have you entered where, briefly, you found yourself on LNC? What musings have drifted into your mind from NEC? Felt the sudden release of NGD/CGD? Sudden leap of understanding NGC/NGP? What lost belongings have you contributed to CND? What time in solitude have you spent on CNP?

You are not powerless in this arena. your actions etc etc a state of mind can bring a lamina to you

I have perhaps exaggerated the thickness of the Ordial barrier between our world and the laminae. this stuff is everywhere and you will now see it everywhere, and by seeing it everywhere, you will bring it everywhere, and bring yourself there. where would you like to visit?

## ●◍◍○ Glossary/Index

Maybe some kind of floating TOC visualization that shows all 27 planes and the path you took reading through them (cube with intricate path forming a shape, can be shown without the cube)

"tableau" shows up lowercased in index - i guess the term is lowercase? should index have title case applied?

add many more terms in laminae and then add them to glossary

- A-Z index of all of them, each showing chapter as source
    + bold the one with definition
    + how to show multiple references on same page? i guess don't

- shared glossary + index?
    + shared:
        * for each term, show which laminae references it
        * if there's a def, show def
    + not shared:
        * glossary with ones which have definitions
        * index for all
- what to do with generically named ones from specific laminae, like LND "Mechanisms" - maybe that's okay?
- check to see if we have any duplicate anchor ids across different file ids
- bold the main reference, but show each chapter that references concept?

so far (some need changing, decide/find and replace, and then REF them):

- in cosmography chapter
    + add "cardinal"? maybe replace "mortal worlds" (only used in cosmo, never used mortal realm - replace prime. used cardinal in CND and NNC and others)
    + petitioner
    + outsider (check if used anyway)
    + mortal
    + portal? (gateway?)
    + prime/prime world
    + planar?
    + extraplanar? like 6 mentions in LNC alone
    + plane/lamina
    + soblei
- places? (cerivalia, anywhere else?)
- races/creatures? (eladrin, balors, etc)
- alignment/"force"?
    + "the force of destruction"

misc:

- remove tooltips from copy/paste? e.g. copy anything with a link and the tooltip text is copied too. but it should be copy-able when hovering over the tooltip...

## ◍○○○ Colophon

Same as "about"?

ask on myanmar/burma/burmese subreddit about this. maybe incorporate some burmese myth into narrator, explain language

- Thanks
    + Thank you to the [Burmese culture](link) for having developed my favorite [script](link) which has been used for beautiful symbols throughout this project.
        * maybe mention my connection and personal feelings
        * See more examples [here](link)
        * Learn more about TODO.
        * Support TODO.
        * Recommended book
        * Also Burmese food is incredible: check out [TODO](link) in San Francisco and [TODO](link) in NYC.
        * burmese well wishing phrase
    + also mention other indic scripts?
    + easydabus/easydamus
    + d&d for alignments
    + hinduism for trimurti
    + wikis
    + friends
- faq
    + how do you pronounce "laminae"?
        * There are [quite a few](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_irregular_plurals_ending_in_%22-ae%22) words in English, derived from Latin, where the singular ends in -a and the plural in -ae: nebulae, alumnae, algae, antennae, larvae, vertebrae. With some exceptions (including algae and vertebrae), the final vowel in British English is generally pronounced like the "ee" in "see", and in American English generally pronounced like "eye".

# Tasks

## ■▤▤ Build

- remove # from file name?? maybe not

### clean

- change spell check to english (make sure to preserve added words)
- check/clean
    + spellcheck
    + check all `\w - \w` (probably replace all with "---")
    + "  " (double space)
    + check footnotes come after punctuation
        * search regex `\^.*\][\.,]`
        * or this `\^\[[^\]]+\][^ \n]` but that messes up even more with nested brackets
        * UNLESS the footnote refers strictly to the portion of the sentence (like an individual word) in which case it can come before some punctuation
- check for english spelling
- go through all the macros
- remove comments

## ■▤□ Title

- tooltip TOC laminae?
- figure out TOC format
- probably change order to all hierarchy first, etc.
- probably figure out way to build it rather than type it fuckin out
- glyphs
    + for non-laminae? maye ၜ for something (close, index)
    + cosmography and facets should be similar
    + first two, written by the Order, shouldn't have burmese glyphs right? maybe other cool unicode

goals:

- immediately enticing
- looks like a full world with lots to dive into it
- the basic structure is either understandable, or understandable enough that it's clear that there *is* a structure
- each lamina can be skimmed for interest and flavor and mystery such that reader can see the breadth of things and dive in as desired

viz:

- content for each:
    + alignment (english and glyphs)
    + demonym
    + name
    + `intro` 1-3 paragraphs
    + `summary` that is like 2-3 sentences (google will show ~160)
    + pic(s)?
- generate from YML (maybe gather some stuff from scanning pages?)
    + `import yaml`
    + `with open (r'index.yml') as file:`
        * `index = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)`
    + `import pprint; pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=2).pprint(index)`

## ■▤□ Styles

- more noticable visited vs. unvisited links (for changelog)
- title page - spacing, caps, weights
- editors note on NNP line spacing is too tight, but not elsewhere?
- table of contents/viz
- blue glyphs in lamina headings - should they be blue elsewhere?
    + see e.g. Equilibrium in intro in 08 Brink
- glyphs after every lamina name?
    + even repeated mentions, like in 08 Brink intro?
- index/glossary

maybe

- glyph tooltips
    + facets
    + laminae
- glyph hover - slow color change or glow?
    + maybe when you hover glyph in header, it highlights the word in subtitle
- h's off? (h3's look wrong, h4's like in CND language...)
- hr's (LNC)
- inline translators notes
    + currently have "[untranslateable, unknown glyph]", how is that?
- drop caps? decorated initials (historiated/illuminated initial)
    + go one heading level deeper?
    + Lombardic/rubricated capitals every paragraph?
- capitalization (demonyms, The Laminaname)
    + i've been capitalizing Ordial, but not cardinal or laminae
        * i guess Ordial Plane or the Ordial should be capitalized, and Ordial" adjective too?
    + in english, adjectival forms of countries/languages are capitalized
        * "the adjectival form of a proper noun keeps its properness (and thus its initial cap) for itself, but also that properness does not extend to phrases that are not proper with the noun form"
            - e.g. "the Mississippi Band" vs "various Mississippian bands"
    + lamina is not capitalized cause it's like plane
    + should Cardinal be, like Prime Material planes?
        * but then there should be a proper noun form, Cardinal Worlds, which eh
        * currently not capitalized, but maybe looks odd e.g. end of cosmography Laminae section
        * might also use "cardinals"? nah use mortals
- middot · (with nbsp before) instead of colons? used middot in CND list
    + how does this look compared to semicolon?
- different/more noticeable styling for :visited links?
    + maybe track in local storage which links user has clicked, so e.g. they might have visited a page but not clicked on a glossary term and unless they read the whole page maybe they didn't see the glossary term
        * maybe like two tiers of :visited
    + also how to combine untranslated and visited
        * unreffable have no href and are grayed out
        * "reffable" ones from stub pages do have hrefs in index and so are not greyed out
        * untranslated vs. visited should be separate styles, maybe untranslated are italic or something, or color vs opacity
    + if a page has changed since user visited it, it should be considered unvisited? tough depending on change, maybe only if it went from untranslated to translated

later

- FOUT for bold quotes
- floating TOC?
- update indic fonts to only include needed characters
    + burmese from `/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSansMyanmar*`
    + do myanmar noto, use https://stackoverflow.com/a/37159128/458614 and uni2ascii
    + done
        * `pyftsubset segoeui.ttf --output-file=segoeui-stripped.ttf --unicodes-file=kannada-tibetan-unicodes.txt`
        * `pyftsubset DejaVuSans.ttf --output-file=DejaVuSans-stripped.ttf --unicodes-file=lao-unicodes.txt`
- tooltip on mobile
    + images - tap to show (might already work?)
    + references - tap should pop up, with link to view more
    + untranslated refs that have no href - does tap open tooltip?
- more mobile and browser compatibility check
    + styles, fonts, what else?
- mobile nav "Contents" could be on its own line so there's space for the others
- [Capituli: Some notes on summaries, chapter divisions and chapter titles in ancient and medieval manuscripts](https://www.roger-pearse.com/tertullian/rpearse/manuscripts/chapter_titles.htm)
- footnotes/hash fragment links should highlight word (and maybe paragraph)
    + maybe like some scroll curlicue drawn around it or to the side
    + or a glow
- footnotes should be margin notes like gwern?
- regular vs translators notes - different footnote numbering?

### fade/cycle stuff

show another random selection, e.g.:

    <span class="guild-term" style="display: inline-block;">
        <span class="guild-term" style="position: absolute; opacity: .1;">Order</span>
        Circle
    </span>

### code tasks

- "about" in bottom right is crowded on mobile
- later
    + change mobile nav bar color
    + full screen?

### font

https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flanker/poliphili/ but it's $20-50 (http://www.studiodilena.com/en/2305.html) from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnerotomachia_Poliphili

could try Bembo font, also based off the same book

for garamond currently using 500 (we ask for 400, but using 500), 600 italic, and 700

## ■▤□ Author

2 = fleshed out backstory and voice
3 = lotsa content - is that it?

- burmese connection? some burmese myth of a writer? there's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawgyi_(alchemist) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizza

ALSO: more translator's notes!

## ▤□□ Visualization

places where viz would make sense:

- TOC
    + between heading and items
    + hover over in one highlights in the other
- overview
    + can remove if TOC nails it
- cosmography

same in all? remove one or two of these?

formats:

- 3 squares of 9 cards each
    + each card shows glyphs, english facets, name, and brief description?
    + this could be Overview page
- could be 3 wheels? though the square grid is easier to grok
- exploding 3d cube
    + card view as above on hover
    + compass rose in corner
    + list of facets too?
    + hovering over glyph/facet highlights all its laminae and mentions elsewhere

so maybe 2 formats, can switch between, and the pretty one shown by default on TOC and grokkier one on cosmography

code:

- https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_points
- https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_lines_fat_wireframe
- https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom

### facet hover

data-facet= (added when processing REFs) and :after content

- (labeled) glyph square on trinym hover?
    + like above and below are the other facets from that axis, dimmed, with text and glyph
    + to the sides are the other axes
- CSS/JS attached to data-facet for hover

### lamina hover

- show three glyphs in :after?
    + probably not in ordial-primer chapter - do we even want those to link?
- probably the same REF popup as anything else
- could expand with facet definitions

## ■▤□ Plates

- border
- lightbox?
- captions? i think maybe not
- link to artist where possible?
- float, or only full width?
- multi-image ones?
- style matching
    + .9 opacity on all? maybe makes them too pale. transparency vignette? filter?
- photoshop
    + "Michael Hutter - Carcosa XXXIV" remove buildings
    + "Floto+Warner - Colourant - orange" eh
    + CEC henry hudson meld images?
    + CEC nausicaa remove person/look at other frames from movie, animated?
- mood board with all the images? per-lamina mood boards for some? at the bottom

### implementation

following discarded:

    MEDIA(some pic about something)

this gets used (no double quotes allowed):

    MEDIA("pic-name.jpg")

## ■▤▤ References

"go to [page title]" link if diffrent page, otherwise "go to text" if on same page?

### spec

Source/main reference is EITHER an h# element with id, or a `<dfn>` element with `id` attr showing up anywhere. Text content of node is the name of term being defined, or the `name` attribute can be it. Definition is optional - the `def` attribute or wrapping element's text (end with period). Id is its or parents `id`. `no-index` attribute excludes from index

References themselves just `a.ref`

    REF[text](page#anchor)
    REF[text](#anchor)
    REF[The Wilt](CNP)
    REF[____[the Concordance]](LGP)
    REF[TODO(artist plane)[the Bauble]](NEC)
    REF[Galabast](#galabast)
    REF[Galabast] # default id is kebab-cased string
    REF[Blighted lovers](CNP#the-lovers)
    REF[wind shifters](LNC#wind-shifters)
    REF[Equilibrium](facets#equilibrium)
    REF[Equilibrium] # whitelist dict of terms to auto-map to facets
    REF[Ordial](ordial-plane) # whitelist with its own id
    REF[some made up thing](LNC#untranslated) # mark as gray with untranslated tooltip but lead to #untranslated anchor on page

- parse
    + parse each file
    + get its ID, title, and filename
        * also get its short description, since these are definitions too
    + get each dfn and element with id
        * exclude the basic headings and other blacklist (like "others" from CND)
- insert
    + get all `a.ref`'s
    + if it starts with "#" done
    + find the actual ref
    + if none, do "hasn't been translated yet", remove href and/or update class
    + if yes, update href with filename

same-page REFs link as normal. if not found, look for page ID transform

## ▤▤□ Gondola Owl


## □□□ Calligraphy


## □□□ Peristalsis

- any other interactivity? any procedurally generated stuff?
    + maybe some sub-projects, like gondola owl could be somewhere
    + calligraphic thing?
    + "list of plates" kind of thing could list them all
