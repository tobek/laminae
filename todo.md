- ~Site-wide glyph visualization~
- Fleshed out glossary/index stuff
- Other misc bits
    + renumber/reorder laminae
    + change URLs to glyphs
    + remove any remaining D&D IP

## underserved laminae

- you know just maybe adding evocative details would go along way. tale of a distant city that does xyz...
- for sure: LGD, LED, NEP
- a bit: LGC, LGP, NED, CED, LEP, NEC

# big questions

- perhaps something changed to seal off the Ordial, and that's why the guild and everyone have no evidence for it?
    + maybe something involving Soblei, wiping out every single aperture, leaving on verges
    + possibly conduit-related (maybe an effort to prevent a conduit-related catastrophe)
    + potentially the author played a role! some hint/offhand comment about how sad she'll be to never visit any laminae again
- how can it support scifi? should it? why wouldn't it?
    + maybe it is totally out of time and some scifi stuff is present, but author doesn't have terminology to describe it (like the instrument)
- meaning behind effects (shifting & gpt3)
- how do the pictures fit into the frame? unexplained? or are they paintings by the author?
- include conduit?
    - (old note) maybe missing from LGC CEC CED or LEC
- how do they interact with each other? have referenced "interlaminal" affairs in Soblei and LED, what is that
- language??
    + can petitioners and mortals understand each other? handwave something? how to petitioners from different worlds understand each other??
    + planescape it's just celestial/infernal etc?
- setting
    + part of our world? tenuously, compatible
    + is there any benefit to using fantasy races? elves etc. maybe not.
        * removed mentions of "human" in guild note
        * various mentions in Unfolding feud
        * lgd bookeepers "race"
        * searched "human" and "race" and accounted for all
- more/better author stuff

# big ideas

- branch out with allusions
    + pick an oulipo process and a myth or concept and see where they go
- doppelganger thing, yeah maybe they are on every lamina, or for author at least, taking different forms on each
- more places that are like... real places one could inhabit
    - so far this is just like the islet conservatory... i guess promenade of congruities, maybe NND caravan. that's it?
- overarching structures, maybe add an appendix, with description of each and updated visualization
    - "understanding laminal perspectives/alignments/arrangements"
    - one viz for each type, all those of the type are highlighted, if you hover then the opposite(s) highlight too
    - maybe some interact with cardinal worlds more directly, others are like reservoirs for forces... see if anything lines up
    - edges: 12x pillars, in 3x cycles of 4 - ones that are neutral in one and extreme on other two. the corners of central squares on cube, they all kind of... go together, some kind of statement about a particular problem. each a cycle
        - synthesis cycle: NGC NGD NEC NED - sort of... channeling our energies and striving
        - utility cycle: LNC LND CNC CND - what to do with the physical world
        - equilibrium cycle: LGP LEP CGP CEP (CEP is a bit of a weird one maybe change) - organizing vast societies? maybe CEP is actually a vast society we don't get
    - faces: 6x "absolutes/exemplars" in 3x pairs - ones that are neutral in two and extreme in one. these exemplify the extreme facet, and with their opposite pair they exemplify the opposing differences
        - LNP/CNP NGP/NEP NNC/NND
    - corners: 8x "extremes" in 4x pairs, where each facet is extreme - these are the weirder laminae, the least hospitable (okay but CEP and CNC and NNP are inhospitable... and LGD and CGD are perfectly hospitable, okay i guess it's just how weird they are)
        - LGC/CED LEC/CGD LGD/CEC LED/CGC
    - 1x NNP

# misc after launch

- feedback
    + i'm interested in primarily in:
        * things that take you OUT of the flow of reading, whether that's
            - something in the world doesn't make sense/isn't consistent ("wait, why would they do that?" or "wait what about...") or
            - grammatical (like something is hard to follow) or
            - stylistic (something doesn't match, breaks the vibe)
        * which parts are boring/you want to hear less about, and which parts you're curious to hear more about
    + i am secondarily interested in:
        * what DOES work for you, things that stand out that you like
- reach out to
    + IJ subreddit to say i put an homage to IJ in here (NGC)
    + comment on https://mynoise.net/Community/user.php?submission=1aa5b0a5ed452c155bd8ef2b1641918773 for NND
    + maybe https://mynoise.net/Community/user.php?submission=dee395a018b838df1107d85c1624162647 too for CGC
    + mechanical monk twitter about that "build spaces like this" beautiful tweet https://twitter.com/mechanical_monk/status/1254837362166829058
- twitter?
    + thread header: brief description and the alignments
    + backdating some already-completed chapters

# backlog

- put facet names in lamina tooltip (copy into ref dict, if present add with appropriate style)
- post it places
- more shifting elements
- ask myanmar subreddit about use
    + could ask the guy that did this https://github.com/vincent-paing/BurmeseProverbDataSet
- how can index and glossary be better?
    + add defs for un-deffed REFs in glossary (especially ones used outside of glossary)

# backburner chunks

- add facet crossovers with Means, e.g. Empathy + Dissolution = vengeance
- every item in index that's mentioned in multiple places should link to those multiple places! especially laminae. would need to anchor to those references
- quotation stuff
    + do something with all the quote authors?
        * like place them in the work, maybe put them in index, etc. certainly vectors guy, maybe rilke
    + explain in frame where they come from? like "i have collected these from..." maybe some are mortals, some petitioners, some are historical, some the author knew, etc.
    + what connects quotes to laminae, just inspiration?
- music
- neighborly relations, e.g. LEC and LNC might get along
    + any time they differ by one facet (or more really), the "what each facet thinks of the other" comes into play
- moodboard images?
    - mood board with all the images? per-lamina mood boards for some? at the bottom

# Sections

## ●◍◍◍ Frame

## ●◍◍○ Primer

## ●◍◍○ Preface

you should be intrigued on the first read, and if you read it again after reading the whole work it should be really powerful

## ●◍◍○ Cosmography

should ordial primer link to laminae and glossary terms?

one more edit pass = 4

contents:

- what's the ordial plane?
    + my answer: it's the imagination
    + don't talk about it as if it's a big deal
- basic mechanics: transport (between, and to/from), etc
- terminology

- major q's
    + afterlife?
    + geography
    + relation to our world
    + how you get there, portals etc. would be weird if author didn't mention, but if author does, does that give the guild hints on where to start?
        * can just talk about apertures but not mention where?
- lamina name
    + ASK:
        * Hey I'm surveying people to get a read on something... How would you think to pronounce the word "laminae" as in the title "Observations on the Twenty-Seven Laminae"? Don't look anything up (at least not first). Also, what meanings/associations does the word have for you?
    + laminae is actually pronounced "la-mi-nai" (~US) or "la-mi-nee" (~UK)
    + just hate "la-mi-nay"
    + latin rule is that words ending in "a" are made plural to "ae" (antenna, formula, nebula). lamina is latin singular. but if i invent a word laminum, the plural ending would be lamina (laminus should be lamini? but whatevs)
        * https://www.dailywritingtips.com/latin-plural-endings/

### general stuff

- general setup of afterlife/petitioners, is that helpful or should these just be places?
- geographic layout - none for now. they're just layers overlapping each other
- ordial plane is boundary/connection between these planes and normal ones
    + https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/6qd9e6/the_ordial_plane_the_plane_of_proof/
    + maybe no discussion of ordial plane, like "everyone knows what that is"
- no gods. they find the alignments of the realm too overpowering and opinionated - the greatest power on each plane is the alignment. of course, demigods and powerful beings are around, but too powerful and they leave. maybe each plane has a core/heart/nexus that matches alignment? all in very different forms - landscape, artifact, building, being (maybe the collective), furniture, work of art. maybe that's where shunts are?

### geography brainstorm

goals:

- easy to grok and imagine
    + easy to grok and imagine relationships/alignment layout
    + and also their cosmic place in reality
- "cool", "wow", "huh"
- as few fudges as possible - and fudges should be clean

i think i'm drawn towards no contiguous geography cause that's what i started with and it's easier?

corners (3 extremes) have 3 borders, edges (2 extremes) have 4 borders, face centers (1 extreme) have 5

can you walk from heaven to hell? no. but like river styx leads to hades - maybe instead of portals there are like passageways and tunnels, or some places do have borderlands?

the gate surface tension thing - does that really matter? none of these planes yet are TOTALLY hostile

might not need elemental planes - no prob not

**contiguous geography pros**

- no need for gates
    + but still need gates to GET there, unless it's all petitioners (which it's not)
- potentially cool big landscape
- easier to grok?
- potentially cool border lands
    + LNC - LNP, NNC, LGC, LEC - all cool
    + CNP - CND, CNC, ~NNP~, CGP, CEP
    + CEC - CEP, NEP, CNC
- potentially cool relationships, especially between C, P, and D versions of same alignment
- cool mountain peaks for C planes and abyss drop-offs for D planes
    + LNC glass ocean i guess flows from NNC into some huge plateau or else it must travel maybe a river through LNP and maybe LND
    + LGD pavilions could be cliff-edge
    + CND could drop through
    + LEC could have panopticons from their peaks (could do this anyway but magically) scouring for beauty

**contiguous geography cons**

NED/NND swap is now interesting. NED would have to be off the edge. NND is like... dropped out the bottom

- is it less... pure? it's more normal
- borders = more stuff to write/figure out
- none of the P or D planes with any N can get to NNP or NND unless some weird underground thing
    + that's okay, they're weird planes
- some hard border lands?
    + went through all, no dealbreakers
    + NND is fine, NNP i guess also
    + LNC surrounded by ocean
        * architects transit across?
        * flat platuea?
    + some (only LNP so far? maybe CNC) don't have sky - it's all ground
        * CNC and/or others could both be underground
    + the crevasse - could just be a wall or mountain range around the whole thing, OR there is actually a top
        * the wall could be a D plane, no "other side" stuff
    + CEC is flat too? guess it could be a gentle slope
    + other possible as-yet-unused challenges: space habitat, underwater
- where do the absolute planes go?
    + could get rid of them, just discussing the "pure" force
    + the nautilus and outpost could be in places like CNC where the fabric is thin

**discontinuous geography pros**

- don't have to figure out borders
- clean?
- i like the idea that every prime plane is potentially connected to all 27, that they're all kind of layered over all reality, that they are everywhere and nowhere, which doesn't fit as well with the contiguous landscape
- doesn't *have* to be a place. these are like physical forces

**discontinuous geography cons**

- have to have portals or something
- easy to grok concept (with 3d cube) but maybe harder to grok... layout

## ●◍◍○ Facets

FINALIZE GLYPHS - just about done!

complete draft = 3 + ready, revised = 4

    The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory ... that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. ... "Ideas" or "Forms" are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato ... sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge.

    "problem of universals" - "Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals [being human, red, big, liquid, circular], but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech" or are simply mental artifacts

- do "paired with" for all facets?
- list "tends to" in pros and cons?
- noun vs adj: noun, "A, B, C"
- goals
    + each can be viewed in a wholly positive light
    + one can be sacrificed for the other
- a name for each axis
    + hierarchy/synthesis/autonomy
        * method
        * control
        * agency
    + empathy/utility/power
        * motive
        * moral
        * incentive
    + creation/equiliibrium/dissipation
        * means
        * force
        * cause?
        * origin?
        * cycle
- name for each and all
    + facets
    + absolutes
- name for axis
    + axis
- maybe the related terms are all given in dichotomies
- finalize glyphs
- relationship between method axis and motive axis
    + tradition vs. secular-rationality?
        * "Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook."
        * "Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable."
        * "People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their sense of existential security increases" (this suggests evil -> good brings about law -> chaos)
    + survival vs. self-expression? power is about survival
        * "Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance." "priority of security over liberty"
        * "Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life."
        * "People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their sense of individual agency increases"
            - this suggests... some relationship with law/chaos axis
    + is this some CG pole? "A specific subset of self-expression values—emancipative values—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal autonomy and the voice of the people."

> "You only go to the wrong place if you fail at your alignment." Thus, an evil person who performs good acts is sent to, for example, Celestia, and suffers there. A good character who murders is sent to one of the lower planes and suffers there. But an evil person who murders is sent to a plane matching his/her alignment and fits right in.
> in 3.5 there is a divine source above the gods that notes whether one is good or evil, because of the presence of "Detect Good" and "Detect Evil." If the gods actually powered the spells it would be "Detect Believer" and "Detect opposing philosophies" as most competent old-time religions define evil as "Not us."
> If the character is punished only by evidence of her acts, in a relativistic system, then use a reputation system as the basis. If the character is punished by beard-in-sky, then keep a rap-sheet of her actions, with beard-in-sky acting on the rap-sheet in any way the setting deems fit.

so what's the process by which a petitioner goes to a lamina? i don't think it should be some magical rap-sheet building up over time and your actions are weighed by some beard in the sky. there is no punishment or reward, it's more: where are you most suited to. the rap-sheet is YOU, how your world and actions have shaped you. after a lifetime of hard work fitting your nature and circumstances into the world around you, you go somewhere where you tendencies are pleasantly utilized. how? TODO(better example) if you roll an object over a surface with carefully cut slots in it, the object will fall through only the slot that fits. does this mean that every soul has a true "shape" - what about non-self... maybe more like reincarnation in a fitting role

maybe some, or even most, souls don't go to lamina, but fall through cracks and go nowhere, or maybe reincarnated for another go round? eh

## ◍◍○○ Close

> We stayed up late in Adderfarthing and spent half the night talking about our old friend Edwina Ballard. It is a consolation, when you are far from home and in a strange place, and especially when some local trouble threatens to catch up with you, to remember people far away who are completely detached from your present concerns.
>
> We were certain, when we woke the next morning in Adderfarthing, and carried our bags away from Ostrich and Fingerroot, that no one was following us, and that there weren’t any rumors about us, and that no one was whispering *Parrigue, Parrigue* from doorways when we went by. But even supposing we are wrong, we have our notes, and our guidebook, our acquaintance in many lands, an ivory and chalcedony figurine of the King under the Mountain (with his face covered in a swatch of vegetable silk), a purse of gold coins, a bottle of anise liqueur; and a contract registered in Lost Drinchham that says we cannot be made to betray each other, not even at the hands of the law.

figure out

- how come the work is basically done?
    - maybe just too old to keep travelling - or can't keep travelling but unclear why
    - "the time has passed for my ordial travels"
- at time of writing closing note, she still on laminae or what's her plan?
- is it different? maybe translator note about it being different - weaker handwriting (too easy), different paper and ink, etc.
- imploring reader to some kind of action or change - what?

maybe she a) was hanging in some lamina finishing up notes, b) next up: go share them with her people, c) go retire in some other lamina, d) aperture accident killed her/tossed her into time suck that spat her out 1000s years later in guild. BUT it shouldn't be random accident, maybe a result of something that she had or carried with her, hint at it. potentially some conduit situation happened between (a) and (b), hinted at, and conduit through aperture was problem

notes

- maybe the only first person is in preface and close (why? intimate, after the fact?)
- maybe here she lists the things she didn't do/still wants to do
    + more experiments on CED, get carried away by eyeboat on NEC, spend more time with NND, hit up universal story again, bring father (alas deceased - maybe different and ambiguous figure) to converse in the light of NGP echo, complete and distribute Soblei map, try out CGC protection method, maybe something about one-time travel companion.
- more hints about the "real" nature (is it all made up? i forget)
- imply that some of reader's experiences have actually been on laminae
- some untranslateable bits
- some personal author bits too, now is the time to drive it home
- kind of an open universe call (some contributions already from readers like you?)
- oh definitely "if you should see this visitor" (but 1st person? "if we should meet") then xyz - sad cause, yknow
- analogies again like the preface
- evoking sense of wonder, that's the purpose of this whole piece, now apply it to your world
- really punchy beginning and end, chills
    - i think making it look forward, as parrigues does, does it. like what's coming next
    - i think some challenge/sadness/regret, like some burden but carrying on anyway

I have carried these Observations with me for a long time, hoping to share etc etc

Reader, do you feel as if you, too, are a visitor?

Reader, it is likely that you, too, have been a visitor on the laminae.

Recall a time when nature wobbled, when you entered a place where the air shone.

Our world is full of the fruits of the laminae.

What would you place/root on these laminae? What works of LEC beauty have you sighted through the thin veil of the Ordial, that one piece in the gallery that was unlike all the others? What structures have you entered where, briefly, you found yourself on LNC? What musings have drifted into your mind from NEC? Felt the sudden release of NGD/CGD? Sudden leap of understanding NGC/NGP? What lost belongings have you contributed to CND? What time in solitude have you spent on CNP?

You are not powerless in this arena. your actions etc etc a state of mind can bring a lamina to you

I have perhaps exaggerated the thickness of the Ordial barrier between our world and the laminae. this stuff is everywhere and you will now see it everywhere, and by seeing it everywhere, you will bring it everywhere, and bring yourself there. where would you like to visit?

## ●◍◍○ Glossary/Index

Maybe some kind of floating TOC visualization that shows all 27 planes and the path you took reading through them (cube with intricate path forming a shape, can be shown without the cube)

"tableau" shows up lowercased in index - i guess the term is lowercase? should index have title case applied?

add many more terms in laminae and then add them to glossary

- A-Z index of all of them, each showing chapter as source
    + bold the one with definition
    + how to show multiple references on same page? i guess don't

- shared glossary + index?
    + shared:
        * for each term, show which laminae references it
        * if there's a def, show def
    + not shared:
        * glossary with ones which have definitions
        * index for all
- what to do with generically named ones from specific laminae, like LND "Mechanisms" - maybe that's okay?
- check to see if we have any duplicate anchor ids across different file ids
- bold the main reference, but show each chapter that references concept?

so far (some need changing, decide/find and replace, and then REF them):

- in cosmography chapter
    + add "cardinal"? maybe replace "mortal worlds" (only used in cosmo, never used mortal realm - replace prime. used cardinal in CND and NNC and others)
    + petitioner
    + outsider (check if used anyway)
    + mortal
    + portal? (gateway?)
    + prime/prime world
    + planar?
    + extraplanar? like 6 mentions in LNC alone
    + plane/lamina
    + soblei
- places? (cerivalia, anywhere else?)
- races/creatures? (removed eladrin/balors/etc, are there any others)
- alignment/"force"?
    + "the force of destruction"

misc:

- remove tooltips from copy/paste? e.g. copy anything with a link and the tooltip text is copied too. but it should be copy-able when hovering over the tooltip...

# Tasks

## ■▤▤ Build

    nodemon - "js,css,md" --exec "python build.py 00-0-title.md"

- remove # from file name?? maybe not

### OG tags

- put trinym in title?
- confirm trinym placement in lamina description
- check/add descriptions and titles for all non-lamina pages

### clean

- change spell check to english (make sure to preserve added words)
- check/clean
    + spellcheck
    + check all `\w - \w` (probably replace all with "---")
    + "  " (double space)
    + check footnotes come after punctuation
        * search regex `\^.*\][\.,]`
        * or this `\^\[[^\]]+\][^ \n]` but that messes up even more with nested brackets
        * UNLESS the footnote refers strictly to the portion of the sentence (like an individual word) in which case it can come before some punctuation
- check for english spelling
- go through all the macros
- remove comments

## ■▤□ Title

- tooltip TOC laminae?
- figure out TOC format
- probably change order to all hierarchy first, etc.
- probably figure out way to build it rather than type it fuckin out
- glyphs
    + for non-laminae? maye ၜ for something (close, index)
    + cosmography and facets should be similar
    + first two, written by the Order, shouldn't have burmese glyphs right? maybe other cool unicode

goals:

- immediately enticing
- looks like a full world with lots to dive into it
- the basic structure is either understandable, or understandable enough that it's clear that there *is* a structure
- each lamina can be skimmed for interest and flavor and mystery such that reader can see the breadth of things and dive in as desired

viz:

- content for each:
    + alignment (english and glyphs)
    + demonym
    + name
    + `intro` 1-3 paragraphs
    + `summary` that is like 2-3 sentences (google will show ~160)
    + pic(s)?
- generate from YML (maybe gather some stuff from scanning pages?)
    + `import yaml`
    + `with open (r'index.yml') as file:`
        * `index = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)`
    + `import pprint; pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=2).pprint(index)`

## ■▤□ Styles

### new questions

- tooltip "turn to section/chapter" copy? "read more" feels to internet-y
- tooltip link to view more on desktop too?
- block quotes from others in LEP and LNC, as well as author in CGC and CED - how to format?
    - former are indented, latter are not. presumably not swashed like intro quotes

### definitely do

- parchment

### please do

- maybe open non-drop-cap sections with italic swashes?
- more mobile and browser compatibility check
    + safari
    + styles, fonts, what else?
- change mobile nav bar color
- tissue guard
- viz legend too narrow on some mobile widths
- footnote tooltips for now? check some v long ones
- favicon
- double middot? lower?
    - maybe single middot for semicolon, double middot for colon, both lower
- wider index - or two columns?
    - letter segregated index
- make footnote target bigger
- "about" in bottom right is crowded on mobile
- decide on shifting palimpsest
- finalize colors and element styles
    + rustier red?
    + background colors
        * manuscript texture?
    + mobile nav bar color?
    + glyphs, facets, laminae
    + #113a6b: glyphs in subtitles, facets in viz, that's it
    + #b00000: links
    + should facets be #113a6b everywhere? just glyph or whole link? viz + facets page
    + should facet glyphs in lamina links be #113a6b? e.g. cosmography intro - also home page TOC?

#### fonts

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41233532/converting-ttf-to-woff
https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools

check if better to do:

    font-feature-settings: "kern" 1;
    font-kerning: normal;

- use fl, st, ff, etc ligatures?
- maybe use terminal forms at the end of chapters
- https://caniuse.com/font-variant-alternates
- but can accomplish with https://caniuse.com/font-feature
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/OpenType_fonts_guide#alternates_font-variant-alternates

### style backlog

#### additions

- glyph square?
- facet names in lamina tooltip?
- full screen?
- gpt3 style
- shift style (overlay stuff)
- footnotes/hash fragment links should highlight word (and maybe paragraph)
    + maybe like some scroll curlicue drawn around it or to the side
    + or a glow
- footnotes should be margin notes like gwern?
- decorative titles and endings (see inspo/styles)
- drop caps updates
    + AKA decorated initials (historiated/illuminated initial)
    + go one heading level deeper?
    + Lombardic/rubricated capitals every paragraph?
    + another common thing is for first word (of which drop cap is a letter) is in small caps
        * and the first non drop cap letter is capitalized
        * also potentially increase letter spacing for that first word
        * could do small caps/letter spacing first word for new sections that don't deserve drop cap
- could decorate facets/cosmography with various flourishes
    - like the cloud burst stuff here https://archive.org/details/utriusquecosmima01flud/page/n52/mode/1up
- could have the last paragraph of a chapter narrow to a triangle centered
    - like hypnorotomachia or
    - or some here too https://archive.org/details/utriusquecosmima01flud/page/n52/mode/1up
    - can use CSS shapes for this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Shapes
- [Capituli: Some notes on summaries, chapter divisions and chapter titles in ancient and medieval manuscripts](https://www.roger-pearse.com/tertullian/rpearse/manuscripts/chapter_titles.htm)
- regular vs translators notes - different footnote numbering?
- floating TOC?
- different/more noticeable styling for :visited links?
    + maybe track in local storage which links user has clicked, so e.g. they might have visited a page but not clicked on a glossary term and unless they read the whole page maybe they didn't see the glossary term
        * maybe like two tiers of :visited
    + also how to combine untranslated and visited
        * unreffable have no href and are grayed out
        * "reffable" ones from stub pages do have hrefs in index and so are not greyed out
        * untranslated vs. visited should be separate styles, maybe untranslated are italic or something, or color vs opacity
    + if a page has changed since user visited it, it should be considered unvisited? tough depending on change, maybe only if it went from untranslated to translated

#### fixes

- mobile nav overflow
    + 14-nnp is tightest lamina
    + "primer on ordial plane" breaks
    + indent under raquo
- FOUT for bold quotes
- update indic fonts to only include needed characters
    + burmese from `/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSansMyanmar*`
    + do myanmar noto, use https://stackoverflow.com/a/37159128/458614 and uni2ascii
    + done
        * `pyftsubset segoeui.ttf --output-file=segoeui-stripped.ttf --unicodes-file=kannada-tibetan-unicodes.txt`
        * `pyftsubset DejaVuSans.ttf --output-file=DejaVuSans-stripped.ttf --unicodes-file=lao-unicodes.txt`

## ■▤□ Author

2 = fleshed out backstory and voice
3 = lotsa content - is that it?

- burmese connection? some burmese myth of a writer? there's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zawgyi_(alchemist) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizza

ALSO: more translator's notes!

## ■▤□ Visualization

### cosmography viz

formats:

- 3 squares of 9 cards each
    + each card shows glyphs, english facets, name, and brief description?
- could be 3 wheels? though the square grid is easier to grok
- exploding 3d cube
    + card view as above on hover
    + compass rose in corner
    + list of facets too?
    + hovering over glyph/facet highlights all its laminae and mentions elsewhere
- could do circle instead of cube - 3 concentric circles, slightly offset so there's room for NNX's
- shit could do just branching 3x, have seen manuscripts in that style, but then have a list of 27 at end. could be offset
- gosh could it be some torus knot? https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TorusKnotGeometry

so maybe 2 formats, can switch between, and the pretty one shown by default on TOC and grokkier one on cosmography

contents:

- nodes with lines between them
- name and triglyph at each node
- some laminae hover state popup
- compass rose
    - drag to rotate would either move the rose around or would have to update the rose
- list of facets
    + hovering facet highlights laminae with that facet (and lines/faces?)
    + hovering facet has facet info popup (maybe same as in rest of text)
    + hover on a facet category colors each facet one of 3 colors, and colors each face with corresponding one?
- hovering in TOC highlights node and vice versa
- maybe hovering lamina lightly highlights each of its facet planes

on mobile, tap = hover

nodes or cubes?

- node:
    + node options
        * circle with trinym in it that faces camera
            * or a shield instead of circle, or an arc above
        * node with trinym above/over and name below (or maybe name only visible if close to camera)
        * no node/point, just trinym (possible name below)
        * dunno maybe text crossing lines would look okay
    + highlighting facet highlights a face + nodes
    + maybe lines that stop short of nodes (dashed if obscured or posterior)
        * even if stopping short, line will still overlap with node in some cases
        * instead node could have color-of-background circle background
- cubes:
    + prob a wireframe cube
    + text (trinym and name) floating in center of cube (facing camera), or
    + text on faces (duplicated?)
        * sometimes will be upside down unless they face camera
        * cluttered with even more than 27 items, unless obscured (totally or partially)
    + NNP can't be seen clearly (that's ok)
    + highlighting facet highlights 9 cubes (maybe fades others)

different colors to make it less confusing

#### viz design q's

- todo
    - compass in middle left, legend on bottom?
    - don't cut off top bottom, more space now
    - tooltip cut off on left
    - remove legend tooltips
    - facet legend on my mobile is squished together
    - bottom of compass glyphs cut off on my mobile
    - fix sprites getting squished on tap
- colors in general
- fog vs panes
- means intersection lines? could be diff color
- go over hover states
    + lamina sprites, TOC lamina, facets, axis names
    + enlarging of lamina glyphs in viz on TOC hover?
    + highlighting glyphs in TOC is too much? maybe darker color for non main one
- facet legend
    + label the whole legend ("Facets")?
- more stylized touches
    + circle or little arc around/over each lamina?

#### viz backlog

- loading state?
    + maybe show facet legend, loading state in middle of viz and compass elements
- hover over compass facets?
- sync up lamina hover with viz on cosmography
- ensure notosansmyanmar font is loaded before rendering sprites? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/font#loading_fonts_with_the_css_font_loading_api
- main viz should go all the way to left edge of page
- stylize ideas
    + means lines from origin point to infinity??
        * change CD_MULT to be an angle
    + bezier curve?
    + could try making each facet edge line stop short of each lamina (and then moving them back in)
        * potentially each line could end in like a shape like:---( ꧪဋဗ )---
    + some framing around the whole thing, and/or facet legend and/or compass
    + some flourish for highlighted facets (and maybe the one highlighted lamina if any)
    + could add more burmese somewhere
    + a translucent reflective sphere around each lamina sprite
    + fog vs translucent unhighlighted facets, not sure
        * to try: disable fog, reenable opacity on facetBaseMaterialOptions, put facetLinesBaseMaterial opacity back to 0.1 prob
    + compass rose could be prettier/more interesting
        * maybe like two triangles planes rotated around each other, each with inwards-curved edges
    + arcs at each corner - just quarter circle lines at every possible corner along the plane of each facet
- could make obscured lines dashed: https://discourse.threejs.org/t/making-invisible-edges-dashed/29824/1

### facet hover

NOT THAT NECESSARY

data-facet= (added when processing REFs) and :after content

- additional description for non-viz, like "Creation is a facet of Means"
- CSS/JS attached to data-facet for hover
- could fade in the adjacent facets on top, with the axis label, and the current one highlighted

### lamina hover

PROB ALSO NOT THAT NECESSARY i mean how many of these are there even - mostly in intro chapters

- show three glyphs in :after?
    + probably not in ordial-primer chapter - do we even want those to link?
- (labeled or hover?) glyph square on trinym hover?
    + like above and below are the other facets from that axis, dimmed, with text and glyph
    + to the sides are the other axes
- probably the same REF popup as anything else
- could expand with facet definitions

lamina links should be e.g. "The Braid ꧪဥဓ" and on hover the tooltip can have the heading and the facets highlighted in the 9 square (which themselves hover tooltip)

    The Braid                ꩧ *ဥ* ꧠ
    description...          *ꧪ* ၇ *ဓ*
    etc...                      ꧹   ဋ   ဗ
    read more ->

could maybe do glyph square on every lamina page

consider mobile

### shifting and gpt3

*PROBLEM* - both guild stuff (just name) *and* author stuff (quotes) shift. so they both do this thing? (don't know who images belong to yet). one option is to make all of these belong to the guild explicitly (would have to update attribution and refernce to quotes on NND and CGC), but like that's a lotta guild content.

some way to always show a certain one the first time, e.g. NGP landscape. just need to keep track of if seen or not. not perfect cause could be off screen but that's okay. probably don't do idle timeout for that page load

shiftwrights
fluxsmiths
fluxwright
driftwrights
driftsmiths
tidewrights
tidesmiths
tidespurs

shift, flux, drift, tide
wright, smith, spur

should they change whenever they go out of viewport view too?? yes! but only if enough time has passed, so you can't game it by just scrolling up and down. also, if no movement for a long long time (no scroll, no change in visibility) then change once. maybe timer for visibility change too so you can't game that. you have to leave it open and come back. and maybe a (50%?) chance that it simply doesn't

aspects

- guild terms/burmese/unfinished titles changing
- image changing (just NGP so far)
- quote changing (just CEC so far)
- AI-generated text

todo

- figure out what it represents
    - which are related to each other?
- figure out what it looks like
- is it interactive, maybe just a little?
- rename gpt tag

show another random selection, e.g.:

    <span class="guild-term" style="display: inline-block;">
        <span class="guild-term" style="position: absolute; opacity: .1;">Order</span>
        Circle
    </span>

instead actually could duplicate the existing one and offset it, double-vision style

for images could show a ghost of other (or same) image offset

#### shift brainstorm

the guild and/or the author can create kind of probabilistic effects that live in the mind of the observer. the guild name is a superposition of multiple names that collapses on observation. the paper/ink somehow has this quality

why? they operate on a more complex level. some things can only be described by a superposition.

GPT3 stuff, easy answer is they came to the author in dreams/possession/hallucination, written in a different hand. "some passages were written in an unusual ink that shifts with irridescence. with some effort we have been able to produce a similar effect [maybe insert some shifting here] for our translation. we are unsure of the significance etc etc"

but why? probably need to nail down the story of why she's writing it and whether it's true or not

maybe they're all margin notes and attached scraps of paper

maybe totally different handwriting or even language - someone added it. afterwards? with or without approval of author? maybe she passed it on to someone else.

ideally hint towards explanation in the text. or it could be totally explicit, that a companion wrote some of it.

all of the above the reason it's different is just to capture that it was written differently, and it happens to be a cool ink. maybe there should be some reason for the interesting effect.

_could_ be similar to the shifting, except it doesn't change does it.

dunno maybe each should be changing, generate a ton of examples with GPT3. but like e.g. unraveller demigods, the good stuff i want to include it all.

#### random shift

goal: you can't "catch" it

short delay: 5 minute
long delay: 1 hour

- if tab is visibility hidden for short delay, shift
- if tab is idle for long delay, shift
- before each shift, random seed is saved to local storage so a refresh won't change latest shift
    - random seed is saved with expiration of long delay, so new page load will be different if that time has passed
- if no local storage, seed is `Date.now() / long delay`, so refreshing within a long delay window won't change
    - (does mean that if no local storage, "initial page load > visibility hidden shift > refresh" will return to initial state)implementation
- guild name shifting has its own separate seed indexed to "guild" instead of the pathname so should be consistent from page to page

## ■▤□ Plates

- man, fullscreen might be good, like e.g. LNC, i wanna see it
- TODO
    - tissue guard default caption could be glyphs like <hr>
    - click > remove guard > click > show attribution
    - shifting element - deliberate looking
    - GPT-3 text is different when highlighted
- tissue guard with attribution, hover to remove?
    + makes me want to do captions which i wasn't going to
- border?
- lightbox? ...probably not?
- link to artist (official site or social media)
    + no need to link to the specific work?
- probably a middot instead of a dash between artist/title
- indicate shifting in any way?
- style matching
    + maybe an overlay of some parchment texture
        * which maybe should be on background anyway? with a random offset (using seeded random)
    + .9 opacity on all? maybe makes them too pale. transparency vignette? filter?
    + like LEC... something is lost =(

### do

- photoshop
    + "Michael Hutter - Carcosa XXXIV" remove buildings
    + "Floto+Warner - Colourant - orange" eh
    + CEC henry hudson meld images?
    + CEC nausicaa remove person/look at other frames from movie, animated?

### management

need to have an easy way to see which images are currently in use and on what page

need to be able to, in one place, update an image to be decided to be used in 1 place, or no longer a candidate for a certain place, etc.

issue: image a gets labeled LEC and added to LEC folder. later, it gets appended with LED and added to LED. from LEC folder you can't see it's pending for LED also. main folder is source of truth

prob need caption, metadata, author link, etc...

maybe just a big JSON file as a data store, update there, run a script and it lays it all out

*before i figure this out need to figure out trinyms, filenames, ordering laminae, etc*

there are currently images in "used" and in laminae with names different from the ones in "possible", and edited too. "used" supercedes. also currently there are some tagged ones in "possible" which aren't in their folders, but just copying naively would duplicate

ideal directory structure/system for everything

-

export pinterest?

divvying up script (should be idempotent):

- delete all the folders
- iterate through every trinym and copy (nested but not into trinym folders?) each into each
- used ones have been copied into "used" but later when removed from "possible" this would delete them

current process for using an image:

- copy into used

better:

- remove from "possible"
- indicate in trinym folder that it's used
- etc

eventually there will be a bunch of candidates that need divvying up

### implementation

following discarded:

    MEDIA(some pic about something)

this gets used (no double quotes allowed):

    MEDIA("pic-name.jpg")

### copyright

hide all unless "logged in"?

in colophon assert fair use for non-commercial work and for (in-universe haha!) educational purposes.

considered under fair use because blah blah blah. hope that i drive eyeballs your way and if i can cite you better let me know. if you'd like anything removed blah blah please let me know.

four factors

1. "advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new". "when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use"
2. non-commercial fictional work
3. amount eh
4. my use does not "serve as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur"

if necessary, VQGAN+CLIP'ing/Looking Glass AI'ing them would probably make them derivative works and then i'd have the copyright: "it must display some originality of its own. It cannot be a rote, uncreative variation on the earlier, underlying work. The latter work must contain sufficient new expression, over and above that embodied in the earlier work for the latter work to satisfy copyright law's requirement of originality", although this bit makes it less clear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work#Lawful_works_requirement

see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformative_use

## ■▤▤ References

"go to [page title]" link if diffrent page, otherwise "go to text" if on same page?

### spec

Source/main reference is EITHER an h# element with id, or a `<dfn>` element with `id` attr showing up anywhere. Text content of node is the name of term being defined, or the `name` attribute can be it. Definition is optional - the `def` attribute or wrapping element's text (end with period). Id is its or parents `id`. `no-index` attribute excludes from index

References themselves just `a.ref`

## ■▤▤ Colophon

- ask on myanmar/burma/burmese subreddit about this. maybe incorporate some burmese myth into narrator, explain language
- add link back to title from colophon?

## ▤▤□ Gondola Owl


## □□□ Calligraphy


## □□□ Peristalsis

- any other interactivity? any procedurally generated stuff?
    + maybe some sub-projects, like gondola owl could be somewhere
    + calligraphic thing?
    + "list of plates" kind of thing could list them all
