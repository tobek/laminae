                            <p>Collected here are the collated and lightly edited notes recovered from the body of an old human woman who was found deceased in the chamber of the Guild's astral replacement device once it had been completed and was activated for the first time. No other incidents have occured with the ingenious device in the months since it has been operating, so we have no precedent or explanation for this event. Regardless, her arrival has provided the Guild with a trove of lore and many unanswered questions.</p>

She carried two items of note: an ivory pendant with a runic motif of a closed eye, and a slender disk the size of an outstretched hand, made of an as-yet-unidentified jet black material. While the pendant appears unmagical, the disk is extraordinarily charged. <!-- TODO (a bit lame, either tone down or add as editors note later)) We fear that it is one of the Shunts of Creation referenced in her notes, and wonder which force in our abundant multiverse may be dangerously unbalanced as a result of the disk's removal from its intended place. -->We have archived it in the library vault for safekeeping.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>Assuming the texts she carried were her own, the only thing we can know about this woman comes from the few personal remarks in her writing, from which we can glean that she was extraordinarily resilient, and fortuitous, and had the grace and canniness to pass through the most unwelcoming of locales. Her body has been dissolved in the Underflow as is customary for honored associates of the Guild.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>These notes have been translated from Abyssal, an uncommon language choice for a human, but perhaps selected for its unusual expressiveness, complexity, and precision. Translation has been impeded by Abyssal's written script, in which unusual terms are inscribed using rare or even totally unique glyphs, resulting in many *hapax legomena*, and, as a result, certain terms and passages have proved beyond our ability to decipher. Additionally, various sections still await the attention of our hard-working translator, and will be entered into this collection as they are completed.</p>

If killed in their home plane, their energy disperses to join the plane. If killed elsewhere, their energy disperses into nothingness. Petitioners tend to look like they did in life, though often are influenced by their new residence, sometimes drastically. They no longer have memories of their mortal lives, except for rare glimpes, but their personalities and mannerisms remain. Most mortals end up on the Outer Planes after death, but those sufficiently attuned to Creation, Preservation, or Destruction will find themselves here.

Mortals residing on the planes may be peasants or workers or may be unfathomably powerful or anything in between, and some live on the plane to aid the plane and align themselves in the way petitioners do, while some are there for their own purposes that may be unrelated to or contrary to the plane.</p>

Esoteric attempts to tap into this plane have nearly always ended in great misfortune - an entire city torn up and twisted through with coral reefs, cotton candy, and hundreds of thousands of chaotic oil paintings from the size of a thumbnail to the size of a castle.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>To be in this plane is to be suspended in what appears, deceptively, to be a directionless nothing.

                            <p>Some safe outpost, ridiculously impenetrable, from which wizards funnel pure creation through atom-wide tunnels through 20-feet thick magical substance in order to test interactions with different substances under different conditions. They live regimented lives, knowing that even within that bastion, spending more than a week will cause permanent insanity and mutation. This is not a society whose members have all gone subtly mad over time - they do not allow any of their members to spend more than 24 hours in the facility, and have outfitted it with sensors to indicate local weather conditions and sometimes have to abandon it for days, weeks, or even years at a time. Mishaps do  happen of course, and it's only through countless generations of study that they have established an outpost and a system that keeps them safe. Those tainted by madness or mutation are never allowed back (through much protest) and are well cared for back home.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>The society is based on Tintibulus[^1], where creative or destructive forces are occasionally packaged and unleased with devastating effect upon entire polyhedra of Acheron, with brief conflagrations of color and life eventually succumbing to the ashen emptiness. The bastions are each anchored by an open conduit to a continental dodecahedron, providing a source of stability and solidity to withstand those planes to where an open conduit helps maintain the outpost. (Possible some conspiracy theory about Primus of Mechanus funding/powering it for research into forces of Creation and Destruction - though those forces are not aligned with Chaos, the Primus is wary of the cycles and struggles between them, and would be much more comfortable if they died down and Preservation prevailed.)</p>

Obviously magical means are excluded from each approach - mechanical means such as parachutes or rock-climbing equipment and portaledges are required. Flying mounts. It's got to be harder than this!</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>As one approaches the Spire's peak, a thrumming sound can be heard with miles. It fills the air with a solid, mind-shattering buzz that, as one gets closer, seems to prevent all conscious thought. One's vision begins to vibrate to the point of incoherence, and the sound obscures all sound, and the buzzing fills the sense of touch and the entire body, such that it's impossible to feel where one's body ends and the rest of existence begins, obliterating proprioception, orientation, gravity, and eventually all awareness.</p>

                            <p>Maybe descendents of an ancient god's effort to mount and control the spire, a race he created to tunnel up the spire, who failed, but who resemble haggard men and women with pure grey eyeballs, oblivious to all interaction from others, kept ageless by Preservation, endlessly going about their futile, Babel-esque task of digging and building.</p>

                            <p>The landscape of ____[this plane] is otherworldly---hushed and soft and still. The sky is perpetual starry night, brilliant and twinkling, while the terrain is rolling and craggy and covered in rock, moss, heather, and occasional scrub, all in shades of deep gray and black, with occasional muted splashes of somber purple or dull gold. A steady cool breeze causes slight movement. Peaks and the occasional valley or cliffside are crowned by glittering pavilions, each ready to serve as the temporary resting place of a single champion.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>Though known generically as pavilions, these structures range in size and style from small altars and follies to sprawling amphitheaters, and they cover the land: from any vantage point you are likely to see at least one pavilion in the distance, and often several. All are made from deep black stone with a subtly colorful iridescent surface and edges that glint in sharp gold. Each calls out to heroes who evince particular preferences: temples and barracks and libraries attracting clerics and warriors and mages, while the size and grandeur tend to match the valor of the champions who wait within them. Innumerable finer distinctions arise: while some pavilions and their champions are more general-purpose, others are dedicated to eternal struggle against ills as varied as necromancy, political tyranny, theft, misinformation, or elemental rampage. In all these cases, structural form echoes motivation and function.</p>

                <p class="line">Those who make the pilgrimage to _____ to seek aid are known as supplicants, and must go through a lengthy and TODO/somber process. First the supplicant must seek out an appropriate pavilion housing an appropriate hero. A handful of esoteric libraries and astral hermits have knowledge or maps of the realm that may aid a supplicant, but even with such guidance you may have to search for weeks, intuiting from a pavilion's construction what glory it may house. Bookkeepers at each pavilion, who are able to quickly rule out many requests, will often offer direction to other pavilions near or far which may be more appropriate, or suggest, if necessary, that no pavilion is likely to aid their quest.</p>

                            <p>The plane's ritual of forgetfulness is mediated by the bookkeeper's robes. Once any being dons one of these intricate garments, their memories become wrapped up in the cloth, the symbols growing and warping as the wearer journeys through awareness. Once the robe is destroyed, all of the memories formed during wearing are erased from the wearer's mind. Before a pavilion begins opens to accept a new hero, the bookkeepers each craft a robe for themselves and wear it. Once a hero journeys forth from the pavilion, they weave new robes and burn the old ones in a ritual that lights up the whole pavilion. Thus all their memories of every hero and supplicant that came their way is erased.</p>

Deliberation may last for days or much more, during which bookkeepers conduct extensive research, often traveling to the location of the challenge for further information.

                            <p>The lights dim as the hallway progresses, eventually taking on a warmer tone and growing hot, until the narrow path gives way to a soaring cleft abutting a dark open space. A maze of low piles of smoldering embers forms a vast, circular walking labyrinth. The room is ablaze with the heat of the embers, but their light is too dim to illuminate either any walls or ceiling or even your own body: everything is suspended in blackness. This visitor walked nearly to the point of losing sight of the maze without reaching side walls, even back to the entrance, tracing the dark anterior wall until, after bordering the previous chamber, it turned away from the labyrinth to continue receding.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>If you choose not to skirt around it, the labyrinth is both welcoming and challenging. One the one hand, though it wends elaborately towards the center and then out again, it is unicursal, with no branching paths, and the embers burn cleanly, releasing little ash or smoke. On the other hand, the heat is extraordinary, lending an urgency to your passage, and if stepping over the cinders to take a shortcut a visitor should beware the ignition of an errant scrap of clothing. The whole passage, all circular curves and right angles, takes maybe half an hour to traverse and has a peculiar effect on the vision, filled as it is for so long with the darkness and peripheral dance of red streaks in a haze of calidity. This visitor had the powerful sense while walking that she was in fact unmoving, as the great, wavering, manifold disc translated and rotated around her body.</p>

Using the great drills and valves which had been developed to tap into and control underground magma for defensive purposes, the eladrin tore a hole in one edge of the volcano, unleashing a torrent of magma that propelled the entire island towards their target.</p>

At the same time, magical and mechanical traps were devised, making extensive and careful use of the generous volcanic activity.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>As this project was underway, elsewhere in the plane Architects had been working for decades with a court of yugoloths that had gathered around an unusually social ultroloth who wished to build an industrial empire atop a ruined world that had tumbled into some blasted Outer Plane. They sought the Architects' aid in order to develop technology to mine deep within the TODO(some thing to mine/gather)[[untranslatable, unknown glyph]]. This budding kingdom had been orchestrating various manipulations of pawns in the endless struggle between demons and devils, as yugoloths often did. Unknown to the Architects, one of their schemes included supplying TODO(weapons and supplies)[[untranslatable, unknown glyphs]] to the balors who were besieging the eladrin. They had encouraged the balors to build a stronghold on the eladrin's land, since a sealed gate to a vital devil citadel lied beneath the waters between the eladrin's kingdom and their volcanic retreat. Ostensibly the yugoloths promised to help the demonic balors launch a surprise attack upon their foes the devils, but in fact they planned to rip open the gate at a less opportune moment in order to unleash a war between them that, the yugoloths hoped, would cripple both sides. The presence of the eladrin was barely known to them.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>The eladrin became aware of this convoluted plan, and also learned of the yugoloths' cooperation with the Architects: that the Architects' work indirectly supported the balors plaguing their society, and furthermore that the leading ultroloth himself frequently visited the plane to oversee progress.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>During the Chorus of Sails festival, when many Architects had returned to the mainland, a team of eladrin entered the Unfolding through the gate which connects every project's island to its eventual site, overpowered the Architects present on the island, and somehow learned the location of the yugoloth project. Using the great drills and valves which had been developed to tap into and control underground magma for defensive purposes, the eladrin tore a hole in one edge of the volcano, unleashing a torrent of magma that propelled the entire island towards their target.</p>

                            <p>"Not since the Scaffold's collapse" is a local idiom used to indicate how incredibly long something has carried on for. This visitor was unable to find any particulars about the event however. Asked, Architects assumed that yes, such a thing had happened long ago, and that records in the Scaffold vaults would surely tell more. They did not, only containing the same oblique references except for one cursory timeline of pre-historical events which listed it without a date. Perhaps it originated as tongue in cheek expression---the presently referenced thing ancient enough to have been happening ever since something which never happened---and from here made its way into the historical consciousness.</p>

                            <p>Amongst those few scholars, mercenaries, and obsessives familiar with this plane, however, a small and wildly dangerous cottage industry has sprung up, accompanied by a certain camaraderie. The plane is something of a holy grail that, if tamed, would hold untold promise. It is reminiscent of that fable of the near-infinite library that contains all possible books of a certain size, which are mostly gibberish but must by necessity have among their member all past and future books, some of great knowledge and power.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>The case of The ____, however, is more tantalizing, since some methods hold promise of guiding you closer to a desired moment! The beauty is that once the desired tableau has been reached, especially if this was achieved with a permanent portal that lets visitors come and go as they please to avoid the gradual burden of the place, it can be explored with none of the hazards of the original place. Enemy defenses or the location of powerful relics in a hostile environment can be explored and mapped out at leisure. One can travel to places normally inaccessible. With a suit fashioned from lotus leaves or shark skin you can swim through fog, and with a large kind of solid snowshoe you can walk on clouds if you keep moving. Lava is lukewarm to the touch and completely solid, acid too is firm and harmless, traps are never sprung, magical defenses hang helplessly in the air, treacherous paths never crumble,</p>

                            <p>To be clear, The ____ doesn't reflect only the prime material plane. It holds everything---the Inner and Outer Planes, the Astral and the Ethereal, wildspace, the Hinterlands, all of it, even the Far Realm. The one exception, perhaps, is Sigil. Tableau of the Outlands are plentiful (notably, magic is not suppressed in tableau there) from which of course you can see Sigil atop the infinite Spire. But since the Spire is infinitely tall, there seems no way to reach Sigil. Must it be there, if it can be seen, replicated in total detail, holding all its secrets? For the slim price of overcoming this plane's natural hazards, we could explore the City of Doors at leisure, unmolested by the Lady or her servants!</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>If Sigil is here, why have all attempts to reach tableau there failed? One theory is that the giant torus visible from the Outlands is not actually Sigil, which itself resides in some pocket demiplane. This wouldn't directly explain the lack of Sigil tableau, but would allow for the apparent visibility of Sigil from tableau of the Outlands without Sigil's interior being accessible, while some other explanation must be found for while Sigil alone is missing.</p>

However, far too many observed erasures have seemingly no connection to this. The TODO/organization, a group of mostly gnomes who TODO, have made it a pastime and competition of documenting erasures, the most successful of which, TODO/name (winning gnome), has personally witnessed an astounding seven monk gatherings (a record), though in only 4 of those was the erased object identified (TODO/name (runner up gnome) holds the record for identified erasures, having traced 5, though first gnome maintains that the 5th is wrong and so they're tied for it.)

                            <p>No one witnesses the actual moment of Erasure---it always happens during a blink or when glancing away from something. It's said that staring at a thing, holding eyelids open so as not to blink, can prevent the monks from erasing it. However, since it is never clear what the monks will erase or exactly when it will happen, it's impossible to purposefully employ this tactic. Even beings of immense clairvoyance whose physiology allow flawless unblinking, omnidirectional gaze, do not consume all the available information at any given time, and move their attention from time to time. During these times, an object will be erased. Erasures are rare (example using some civilization), though a handful of beings are known to be have been the presence of more than one. Infamously, mighty wizard TODO/name (haughty wizard) who deemed every speck of dust in his dwelling to be in absolute focus in his mind at all times, found after several days of a half dozen monks that his TODO (important wizard belonging) vanished while he was in the same room having just used it.

                            <p>No one witnesses the actual moment of Erasure---it always happens during a blink or when glancing away from something. It's said that staring at a thing, holding eyelids open so as not to blink, can prevent the monks from erasing it. However, since it is never clear what the monks will erase or exactly when it will happen, it's impossible to purposefully employ this tactic. Even beings of immense clairvoyance whose physiology allow flawless unblinking, omnidirectional gaze, do not consume all the available information at any given time, and move their attention from time to time. During these times, an object will be erased. Erasures are rare (example using some civilization), though a handful of beings are known to be have been the presence of more than one. Infamously, mighty wizard TODO/name (haughty wizard) who deemed every speck of dust in his dwelling to be in absolute focus in his mind at all times, found after several days of a half dozen monks that his TODO (important wizard belonging) vanished while he was in the same room having just used it.

                            <p>Unravellers here specialize in individual cultures and kingdoms via extensive study,^[As is so often the case here, that expertise is sought out by visitors and gladly shared.] and then enact targeted political traumas: framed assassinations and thefts, provoked ceasefire violations, sabotaged negotiations, tweaked documents and maps, betrayals small and large triggering anything from internal conflict in a familial dynasty to the collapse of entire civilizations. TODO(connect with LEC?)[] One Unraveller told this visitor that he was visiting from a different (and far less pretentious, he assured) troupe focused more generally on plans gone awry.</p>

                            <p>The decay of magic is the focus of a troupe that consist of a single building, perhaps the only structure here that reaches to great heights: a huge and gently floating gray tower, all terraces and staircases, teeming with creatures embedding magical items and gems and arcane trinkets into the wall, all dull and broken, lodged inside and out such that the tower bristles and overwhelms with more foreign matter than stone. An open chamber at the top of the tower is the sole corner of the entire plane this visitor found to be off-limits, guarded by dozens of large and misshapen golems cobbled together from yet more repurposed relics and filling a narrow spiral staircase, for the top of the tower is where artifacts not-yet-dispelled of their power are brought, and so has been the frequent target of treasure hunters and pursuant prior possessors.</p>

The still air fortunately stirs few aromas towards the engrossed banquet in front, but throughout and behind this troupe the odor is tremendous---not specifically noxious but simply overwhelming: a ripe, florescent maximalism that appears to trigger every sensation in the nose at once and thereby crowding out one's other sense. These ponderous, gentle, dedicated Unravellers slip into kitchens and food stores around the multiverse and slowly wreak their havoc, returning to bask in the warm ferment of the work here.</p>

Some are straightforward---for instance any Unraveller from a particular troupe of cooking can shriek "Consume!", causing all activity to cease and every member to rush to the food-laden tables---while many are more arcane. This visitor witnessed an entire troupe of buried-decomposition Unravellers come to a dead stop, stare at each other wide-eyed, burst out into uncharacteristic cheers, and then simultaneously disappear.^[A cherubic age Unraveller from the adjacent troupe guessed cheerily that another civilization had been swallowed by an earthquake.] Some shared trigger periodically inspires fire Unravellers to set their own bodies alight and join together by the hundreds into an intricate and primordial dance stretching out past either side of the Procession. Neighboring troupes of cooking and spoiled food occasionally decide to join their troupes together in a stupendous mayhem often resulting in their switching places with one another. Something is always happening.</p>

This is a place where you could drop a demon into the middle of the realm, and the natural order and layout of things would guide him to be an enlightened angel. The academics of ___ study and pore endlessly over TODO to establish a perfect order that does not strive to insulate itself from the multiverse but that strives to create an endless bastion that can weather any change without doing anything except growing and perfecting.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>Maybe a loose confederation of small cities, all within same min and max size, and if these ever fall or rise outside of these ranges they must split or consolidate. Cities A/B test themselves, with the most successful (mainly only by immigration and not births; births get re-assigned and raised collectively?) spreading, all aiming for the perfect civilization.</p>
                        
                    
                        
                            <p>They are really really good at it. no issues with wireheading or "is struggled needed for happiness", the answer is obviously yes, but the struggle need not be suffering, there are hierarchies, there are successes and failures, value systems which petitioners strive to do well by and feel disappointment when they don't or others perceive that they don't, etc. but obviously this is a factor of great experimentation among cities. (or wait, is there some disagreement between LGP and CG...P about whether suffering oh wait at the otp right so either re-work this, or emphasis struggle vs. suffering).</p>
