what's the point?

- WOW incredibly beautiful just WOW
- some broken eggs to make this omelette
- intimidating
- requires narcissism, which bears fruits
- beauty is complicated - objective/subjective, dependent/disinterested, etc.
- hyper-sensitivity to relative power/beauty, judgment, shame -> incredible beauty
- sacrifice in its pursuit
-->

The Slender is a slick dark gleaming realm of all the aspirations of beauty of the multiverse. All of the light and color has been slicked out of this realm in the service of the creation of beauty---the ground is blank and even the stars, they say, were plucked out of the black sky to adorn the fantastical crowns and capes of the Reals. All that punctuates the landscape are the curling towers and palaces licking the sky, in which Reals endlessly meld their minds and bodies in the pursuit of beauty.

This is a place of self-made beauty. For those petitioners that arrive not blessed with beauty, they may shape themselves accordingly or bear the honor of being transmuted into materials for those more worthy of the substance.


- name
	- The Bauble
	- The Crenellation
- demonym
- environment
	- pebbly black desert and blank sky since in the past all resources in environment were used? even the stars plucked out of the sky to decorate. so everything stands out even more
	- no weather or seasons
	- no light
- culture
	- dark eldar
	- bottom x% constantly sacrificed/transmuted? LEP too
		- can choose to be sacrificed OR transmuted into some more beautiful form (grotesque ish)
	- led by the most beautiful
	- varying standards of beauty, some impenetrable to outsiders
	- celebrating masculine vs feminine vs other - various categorizations?
	- different forms of beauty
		- pursuit of mathematical beauty?
		- writing scripts
	- light bearing is a thing, cause it's pitch dark otherwise
	- experiment with their lives to change conceptions of beauty
	- perfection enforced by punishment from judges?
	- constructed according to elegant mathematical proofs that are visible for all to see
	- beautiful and warped beings

info gathering

- questions:
	- who's judging?
	- how do they interact with the cardinal?
		- inspiring cardinals?
	- power and knowledge as well? maybe power. too similar to athletes?
		+ i guess beauty of abstract concepts sure, and in form
- research
	- read nietzsche, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty
	- aesthetics
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_fluency_theory_of_aesthetic_pleasure
- elements
	- looking for the chosen one
	- mirroring/doppelgangering
	- sex
	    + sex ed: everyone tries everything and then chooses what they're into
	    + a failed free love and sex world, because "taboo is revealed to be as fundamental aspect of sexual arousal as the unknown is to the intellectual. The people demand a strict morality police after an era of total acceptance drains all the fun out of it. Everyone is fully expected to both seek out sexual thrills and aid in the swift punishment of anyone who seeks out sexual thrills"
	- caste systems signaled by fashion and mannerisms
	- sexual proclivities replace other tribal markers and are increasingly fractured
	- many sex partners but only one friend, good form to break up before making another, cheating, etc. (some kind of power-couple thing)
    - "Rather than classical "good health," fashionable people sculpt their bodies into interesting shapes with the help of highly specific and commonly-performed exercises prescribed by regimen-planning software." <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia#WZCDyzJxnPweLEH6Z>
	- Keynesian beauty contest? yeah i mean who is judging
    - UP NEXT: GO THROUGH ABSTRACT CONCEPTS then carry on with Procedure
    	- read beauty wiki too
- notes
	- Like Barbarella society, decadent
	- nowhere channels Creation more focusedly - the islet conservatory does it very carefully to great effect, and CGP do in their own cycles, but wow this place
	- "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239
	- "person with taste can observe things going on around them and identify points of interest. by doing this, they make the reality they inhabit more interesting. you can create real value this way. it has an emotional impact on people. you might use words, or photographs, whatever. you could maybe think of this as being a "beauty-worker". you create beauty by identifying it, contemplating it, understanding it, accentuating it .if a shaman is a meaning-worker, maybe an artist is a beauty-worker. or a certain subset of artists" - https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1464230021254377475
	- <gpt>A mighty mountain is split evenly down its center, and on one side stands a gorgeous woman eternally chiseling the stone into perfect statues of the most beautiful men and women. The other half is populated by statuesque giants who lust after her, and in doing so their bodies and minds slowly deform and harden.</gpt>
- research notes
	- beauty = "pleasurable to perceive"
	- beauty is transcendental
	- objective and subjective but also intersubjective (depending on group, keynesian beauty contest)
	- dependent beauty: an ox that is beautiful as an ox but not as a horse, or a photograph that is beautiful because it depicts a beautiful building but that lacks beauty generally speaking because of its low quality
	- could you circumvent the assertion of one's beauty by developing yourself to have different standards of beauty, without faking it?
	- the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion (disinterested pleasure), which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity (not disinterested pleasure)
	- a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty due to her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work. can allow responses to beautiful things to lack pleasure while insisting that all beautiful things merit pleasure, that aesthetic pleasure is the only appropriate response to them
	- explaining beauty according to its role in sexual selection - does this still hold here? guess it could come from past
	- free beauty = independent of what the object ought to be. dependent beauty = beautifully fitted for a particular purpose
	- narcissus - character and flower, "i grow numb" interesting
		- "there is no clarity on whether a flower is named for the myth or the myth for the flower, or if there is any true connection at all"
		- "Pliny the Elder wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (ναρκάω narkao, 'I grow numb'), not the youth."
