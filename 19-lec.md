what's the point?

- WOW incredibly beautiful just WOW
- some broken eggs to make this omelette
- intimidating
- requires narcissism, which bears fruits

Like Barbarella society, decadent

nowhere channels Creation more focusedly - the islet conservatory does it very carefully to great effect, and CGP do in their own cycles, but wow this place

"a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239

"person with taste can observe things going on around them and identify points of interest. by doing this, they make the reality they inhabit more interesting. you can create real value this way. it has an emotional impact on people. you might use words, or photographs, whatever. you could maybe think of this as being a "beauty-worker". you create beauty by identifying it, contemplating it, understanding it, accentuating it .if a shaman is a meaning-worker, maybe an artist is a beauty-worker. or a certain subset of artists" - https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1464230021254377475
