# Site Notes

# Macros

## TODO

- remove TODOs and replace with brackets
    - e.g. `TODO/blah (blah blah) [something]` (spaces optional)
- format for converting TODOs to fragments (perhaps unclear translations)
    - simple `TODO/thing (details)` should be like "can't make it out"
    - how to handle "reword this"?
        - if passable, make sure TODO is contained and can be removed harmlessly
        - if not possible, different format to replace with "passage unreadable"
            - or html comments if it shouldn't be included at all
    - for big missing pieces, present stubs as incompletely translated ("editors note: this chapter has not yet been translated, but to our understanding it...")
        - one of them can be like "this is totally incoherent?"

## ____

something that needs filling once figured out

`____(note)[replacement for now]`

`____[replacement for now]`

check others maybe no brackets just cut out

for now, some can be just removed, others...? search and see

## SKIP

skip entire section up to the next equal or higher heading

# Writing Style

- are they notes or is it a manuscript? i think incomplete manuscript. include this in translators notes, and then i get to leave stuff as notes!
    + in-universe notes should be marked with indic script bullets
- Switch from florid to very sparse and blunt on occasion.
- There is one writer
- Metric system? TODO does that feel too modern? i've used yards in NNP
- English spelling
- Lists with **bolded headings** that flow in the sentence, not always starting it (see LNC and CND figures/groups)
    + TODO reconcile CND and LNC, maybe change LNC to be more like CND
    + period if complete sentences, otherwise not
    + colons acceptable? used in CND but maybe not
    + LNC: sentences starting with bolded ending in period
    + CND: eh
    + (maybe bold/italic if that looks cool in font)
- From Annals: "Therefore we hope to offer a selection of the consolations we have accrued here and there — evidences of absurdity, charm, eccentricity, joy, virtue, friendship, or unlooked-for luck — that make the road worth traveling despite all."
- abyssal: "unusual expressiveness and complexity"
- present tense when describing things, but past tense when referring to "this visitor" such and such?
- footnotes vs. parentheticals vs. em dashes
    + em dashes: surprise, quirky observations and consequences?
        * describe the detail of a thing
    + parentheticals: technical correctness?
    + footnotes: lengthy versions of either of the above? should personal asides primarly be in footnotes, or is that determined by length?
    + about infinite jest: "pieces of information that are important but not integral. In short, they are remnants of [DFW's] consciousness that he cannot part with"
    + so, they should be sentimental? parentheticals for technical details?
    + footnotes are also "notes and errata"
- capitalization
    + capitalize demonyms
    + capitalize alignments
    + capitalize in-plane groups and places like Scaffold, Procession, Patterners, Tillers
    + capitalize "The" in plane names? have been NOT, e.g. "the Netherlands" or "the Levant" (although "The Hague" why?)
        * doing so is a little pretentious?
        * note that wiki doesn't link the "the" in "the Netherlands"
    + prime? so far yes for both Prime planes and Primes as being, Prime-wards, etc.

## Grammatical person

- annals
    - 1st person from annals of the parrigues - no "I" ever?:
        - "When there, do be sure to greet the mine-foreman called Serena the Geologic, an old friend to the authors of the present work."
        - "One of the authors of the present volume here invested in a twill vest. The purchase has proven a valuable investment."
        - "We recommend trying the local specialty..."
        - "Residency When an acquaintance of the authors moved to Minchenbrooke Wells, she received from the neighbors a bud of clover..."
        - "We climbed up and obtained a view of the entire town..."
        - "We stayed up late in Adderfarthing and spent half the night talking about our old friend Edwina Ballard. It is a consolation, when you are far from home and in a strange place, and especially when some local trouble threatens to catch up with you, to remember people far away who are completely detached from your present concerns. We were certain, when we woke the next morning in Adderfarthing, and carried our bags away from Ostrich and Fingerroot, that no one was following us, and that there weren’t any rumors about us, and that no one was whispering *Parrigue, Parrigue* from doorways when we went by. But even supposing we are wrong, we have our notes, and our guidebook, our acquaintance in many lands, an ivory and chalcedony figurine of the King under the Mountain (with his face covered in a swatch of vegetable silk), a purse of gold coins, a bottle of anise liqueur; and a contract registered in Lost Drinchham that says we cannot be made to betray each other, not even at the hands of the law."
        - "Concerning Emport’s provisions we have nothing to say^[My co-author means to indicate by this that there was an accident that destroyed all of her notes for Emport. She regrets this extremely, but there is nothing that can now be done.]."
        - so and so "claimed to recognize one of the authors, but she responded that they were not acquainted" - maybe somewhere where EVERYBODY seems to recognize one of the authors, this was assumed to be a trait of the plane, but didn't happen to anyone else, so... make of it what you will
    - 2nd person from Annals - often 3rd person (singular or plural), but rarely or never "one"
        - "It's not easy to get to and from... your best hope is to persuade..."
        - "Those wishing to take up residency..."
        - "A dedicated traveler would..."
        - "If you are a frequent traveler—as we suppose most of those reading this book must be—then you may..."
        - "If you are lucky, you may be able to"
        - i think there's also "reader," can i use this? maybe. (used in LNC promenade of congruities)
- use 2nd person freely, also 1st person plural to mean author and reader/others
    + so, rarely "one"? would it be weird to go back and forth? i guess instead of "one" use "a visitor" etc.
    + have used "you might wonder"
- "the present work", "this work", to refer to her stuff
- use "we" only for
    + the most general sense ("we mortals", "gods as we know them")
    + maybe: "we" as in the reader and the writer, as in "as we have discussed..."? haven't used yet i think

# Author

- Name - Alea?
- Predictions that come true or repeat. What same thing could keep showing up on different lamina that's more about her than the multiverse?
- how tough is she? e.g. facing the CEC kids.
    + gracious, self-controlled, clever
- travelling with a companion somewhere, maybe with consequences?
    + maybe met someone in the Bell, or the Inevitability
- pick one plane that the annals of of the parrigues could take place in, and then:
    + "it was here that this visitor picked up a book called The Annals of the Parrigues describing the area and, though she had been traveling for some time already, it was this book that persuaded her to turn her notes and journals into the work you are now reading, and to which she owes some small stylistic debt for having been granted by it the liberty to occasionally interject her experiences into these pages."
    + actually it would be better if she actually meets them, maybe they just completed the book, gave her a bottle of anise liqueur. describe the couple, clearly at the end of a long journey and glowing with experience and still-growing affection for each other
- example from nyt goop article. gp talks about 3rd child, writer says she later cried. then later in article she describes a session of self doubt that involves her lack of 3rd child. it's clear that that's when she cried
    - maybe could be like at some post-painful beautiful moment "it was later, when this visitor realized that she would never again be setting foot in any of the laminal realms again, that all the collected stress and beauty of her years of travel would flow through her in a flood of tears" and then later you see the what and why of why she has to never step foot in them again.
- there's something special about "the next day..." with a forward-looking commentary for the ending. "years later..." tries to do the same thing but it's not immediate enough, and we already have a "years later" in the frame story.
- "...its priests wear a silver spiral around their necks as a sign of their dedication, and in solidarity with them I too [now] wear the spiral." from slate star codex thing
- the ivory pendant she has in frame frontmatter - change and/or connect to plot
- the soblei bead map - does she give it away?

    descriptive moral relativism holds only that people do, in fact, disagree fundamentally about what is moral, with no judgment being expressed on the desirability of this. Meta-ethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong.[1] Normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, everyone ought to tolerate the behavior of others

i don't think her position should be that "no one is right or wrong"... but then what?

### back story

early thoughts: daughter of a noble who left, buddha like, to journey and leave it all behind, maybe after a civil war. absolutely no combat nor magic skills or anything. if she had stats, they would all be... str 9, dex 11, con 13, cha 13, int 11, wis 15. no rpg class.

journeyed her whole life but spend lots of time in some of these places, in at least once she considered living forever there because she loved it, but she didn't want to fall prey to dogmatism, this work would remain incomplete if she had stayed

ok so if the ordial plane is the imagination, then she is imaginative. she could be a creative genius that is responsible for the whole ordial thing, so her goals could be just creative production. maybe after some trauma she fell into a a creative delirium. NO BETTER: she had a formative experience with some political strife that led her to want to convince people that these political absolutes belong to the laminae only (where they are perpetuated by natural forces and semi-no-frill-will'd people) but that on cardinal worlds we must cOexIsT. a world with just sheep or wolves wouldn't work, except a superatural one.

- not just a female-gendered male character
- possible objectives:
    + no good or evil, everyone makes sense in their context
    + and no one paradigm works for everything
        * although that's what Synthesis and Utility say. but likewise in practice you can't adhere to either of those dogmatically?
    + exploration, wonder, research
    + finding a home
    + fixing something - tracking down a family member, righting a wrong that someone (maybe herself) did
- why is she writing this?
    + sharing knowledge
    + more existential, like this is the nature of reality
    + maybe also like "understand all types of beings"
        * maybe was caught up in (or helped create) a conflict, and was totally humbled, and wants to learn and help prevent it from happening again
            - conflict could have involved not understanding what a lamina was for
        * "the universe takes all types of people"
    + atonement
        * she grew up dogmatic and sheltered in a royal family and participated in their evil deeds that felt good to her and were driven by perception of evil others
        * civil war ensued, she was cast out, revelation when meeting the other side
        * inspired her to write this fiction, and it took off
- i can see her spreading word of laminae to different laminae
- does she have ties to a community?
    + community destroyed in something connected to the beginning of her journey, or
    + she was outcast, also connected, or
    + child of nomads, or
    + yes, she has a community - why did she leave?
- if she has some objective, and if impossible/failed, then maybe on echo plateau something like "it was here that this visitor formally gave up on the cause that began her journey" or something
- personality traits
    + humble, funny/amused, listens, regal, simple, kind, accepted by everyone, absolutely no expectations from anything ever
- her fate and fate of her work
    + some aperture gone wrong, or maybe emergency exit from The Cartography
    + no time stuff, rather she got suspended in some stasis for a long time and the Order unlocked it
    + another copy had been made before this happened, and/or someone (an Inevitability visitor?) made a copy? maybe at the archive (LNP)

### moments

- in detail above:
    + Parrigues
    + crying/self-doubt
    + finds a companion
- author having an argument with someone over something, mentioned say in footnote
- one plane, fairly late on, "it was through this portal that this visitor first set foot in one of the laminae"
- also fairly late, a simple note that this is this visitor's favorite spot in the multiverse - maybe it has to do as much with relief from something really difficult. coming out of the cave in spain, a fire.
- one spot where she spends a very very long time, nearly retired from traveling.
    + but then this work would be incomplete and she'd fall prey to the same dogmatism etc etc
    + promises to go back there in the end
- this visitor was honored to be invited to participate in [such and such ceremony], though of course she was not permitted in the [special place]
- something omitted for it would not reflect well upon this visitor
- close call (maybe somewhere not particularly dangerous). It was here, of all places, that this visitor came closest to mortal harm, when a ____
- show kindness, show listening, show humility
    + "as is customary, this visitor left an offering..."
    + did not wish to bother, but made space for her bedroll...
    + apologizing genuinely for breaking some norm, and then speaking to the offended person for a long time about it, understanding

### First person terms

Always just one? Maybe joined by someone briefly.

- this visitor - a little otherworldly so that's cool, like not just traveling but visiting, humble
- this traveler - kind of... nicer? but also more boring
- your traveler - personal in a pleasant way, calls attention every time
- NO
    - your visitor (not visiting the reader)
    - your correspondent (the economist)
    - this wanderer (too fluffy)
    - this explorer (too grand, not humble enough)
- this guest (maybe sometimes?)

What about when multiple references are nearby? like CND Procession Shape, footnote

examples:

- More than once this visitor was excitedly regaled with a story of one design associate who...
- Some Architects this visitor has spoken with about this refer vaguely to...
- What struck this visitor most was the contrast between the inexorable and graceful movements of active wind shifters, and the awful stillness of their constructed echoes on the plateau.
- Reader, The Unfolding is resplendent with masterpieces, but walking the full length of this promenade left this visitor blind with wonder.
- ... and some have apparently turned to backtrack from here. This visitor however had traded her...
- Beholding the wanton crowd, your traveler searched and found no malice

when decided, update the frame story

# Things to use

- weirdtopia <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia?postId=cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69&view=postCommentsBest>
- Dissimulation

### The Glassing

positive -> mirror
mineral -> gem? glass? some kind of hard shiny carbon, diamond, or coal?
radiance -> honey? glass? just solid glass all the way. or swap with positive
lightning -> metal? metal wire/strands?
steam -> rust and/or ground glass

### Think about for each

- Environment
    + Landscape
    + Seasonality
    + Weather
- Review author notes and think about how to insert
- How do they greet each other? Cultural tics
- How they interact with prime worlds
    + if destruction, they consume, if creation, they overflow
- Nature of petitioners
    + https://realmofadventure.fandom.com/wiki/Petitioner#Petitioners_of_Specific_Planes
- Something that changed over time
    + e.g. the komusou - anonymous monks so attracted bandits etc

### Foci (high-ish priority?)

e.g. entropy, architecture, the bloom's mutation

(move from above and below into here)

- One where she finds the Annals of the Parrigues - some library, or some place connected to a cardinal world?
- One should be extremely short (maybe no or very few known residents?)
    - like "_____ appears to be a complicated place, but thanks to the efforts of the Forgetful Duke, it all seems rather simple once you've left."
- Which is the most populous? LGC? Would be good for LGC's character but prob doesn't make sense that most people are that. Maybe LGP. Might not be about which alignment most people are, but how well the plane keeps petitioners around?
- Generation ship (high-tech-low-tech caravan across 100,000 mile desert - why?)
- Restorative justice destination (NGP?)
- One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move
- Some kind of mirroring or doppelgangering in the way it responds to you
    + james richardson vectors (see in quotes) "You who have proved how much like me you are: how could I trust you?" some kind of doppelganger thing
    + maybe weirdly LGC? NGD, CGD, CNP, LEC, LEP, NEC, CEP
- saying yes vs. saying no
    + LND or CNP is no?
    + 'The afterlife is comprised of two territories: not heaven and hell, but a world for those who said "yes" more than "no", and its opposite. Yes-world is flowing, a realm without boundaries, and of your soul it makes a river and a flux, a joyful playdough being that absorbs all it touches. No-world is a sequence of diamond-walled gardens, and from safety you watch beautiful terrors flicker through the crystal' <https://twitter.com/ctrlcreep/status/1100085668397699073> ('But what if I had to spend my life mostly saying yes against my will')
    - maybe this is in cosmology, someone went to exactly 2 planes and then said the above, lead the way into there being more
- Some destructiveness focusing on sloth/inertia - activity is actively punished, but in the laziest way possible. If too proactively punishing, the punishment is punished. maybe CED or NED or LED
- Lost and found (maybe in CEC or CNC or LNP) (maybe connected through some weird backdoor to the storage plane?) (i guess CND too, maybe a rumor of a lost objects troupe you can sometimes find stuff in)
- All beings part of a single collective intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic mind, or are actually different minds)
- Two sides that have ritual border. Ceremonies about hating each other, but they never actually fight (two walls place?)
- Some enormous oral history (perhaps song in unknown language) that everyone learns and memorizes but only elite understand what it means - laypeople are only as necessary initiated into bits of it where they learn this thing they've been doing/saying all their life actually means XYZ (maybe NGP LGC LGP - "The Retelling")
- Sex
- Something ridiculously hazardous
- sleep
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#In_mythology_and_literature
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sleepers
- strange loops
    + Synthesis lamina. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it
- used
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_method
    + an infinite jest (/burning man/blockchain/lsd)-inspired thing, something where everyone annoyingly loves it, raves, but it's actually good and changes your ife

### Physical, Environmental, Aesthetic

- A single giant wall, no ground or top (is there secretly a top?) two sides but no way to get from one to other - no one has dug far enough. people talk mythically about "the other side". but since it's infinite, two places too far apart to be reached on foot/climbing, how do you know they're not on the same side? people have attempted to map it out but many locations still haven't been connected
    - if there is a top (or bottom) it should be sheared off absolutely flat like a glitch in a video game
- Sort of like the wall place, one place could be an endless crevasse
    + maybe 100 feet across (need to conceptualize it - tennis court?) so daylight is limited (very, it would converge to block out all light unless plane's geometry is differnt, or it slopes outwards? maybe slopes out and never seems to increase in distance), especially if the people above you have many bridged buildings..infinitely tall and deep. maybe there's one area only where the distance varies - like an amphitheater. a city used to be there but now there is only a lone demon - probably XEX
    + "Karaz_ca_01" pic
    + the wall gardens here!!
- No "ground" is known, but this realm is laid out as a lattice of gnarled and winding mostly-horizontal projections of rock. Crags and massive plateaus give way to tendrils of stone sometimes no thicker than 10 feet wide that protrude wildly sidways into the air without any support underneath it. And entire pathways do occasionally snap, falling upwards as often as downwards. maybe CNC or LEC
    - The capital, known as The Anvil, rests on an unusually solid mass of rock that, viewed in profile, resembles an anvil. On the tip of the long, slender horn rests the palace of TODO/ruler.
- Underwater
- On water
- Floating islands
- Endless river delta
- R'lyeh
- The entire plane a single spiral corridor (NO THAT'S BEEN DONE)
- Church
- Valley cathedral, like that photo I took in Molasses (?)
- Gothic architecture
- Endless castle/palace (maybe LEP/LEC?)
- Maze (LEC?)
- (Traveling) Carnival (is this CND already)
    - "Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social satire; mockery of authorities; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms."
    - in Roman Saturnalia, masters and slaves feasted together, or masters provided table service for slaves, also a time for free speech where slaves could say anything
- Cemetery (same as prison plane?)
- W40k teeming Terra - maybe LGC but that might not fit yet. LG would be ideal, but any L ok
- Japanese garden
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_garden_features
    + stumpery (nicely piled dead trees)
    + stepping stones
    + waterfall
    + monopteros
    + moon gate
    + moss lawn
- Orchard
- Something like a space habitat
- Like a temple space station with galaxy backdrop, see one of the Philippe Druillet pics
- Cofferdam (enclosure in a body of water)
- Smoke
- Black desert (and its oases!) (maybe CNP, or CEC if nothing else)
- Murals
- endless black/white tiles
- Literal walled garden that exemplifies issues with metaphorical walled gardens?
    - But also walled gardens for protection from elements https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden
- Smells
    - sour, citrus, bitter, pine, vanilla, ash, resin
- Everything is black and white - maybe CEP or CED? or NNP. or... LGC or LGP?
    - (except visitors and their stuff? what about their stuff left behind?)
- stelae (carved stone slabs)
- *eremia* "a solitude, an uninhabited region, a waste," from *erēmos* "uninhabited, empty, desolate, bereft," from PIE *\*erem-* "to rest, be quiet"
- Medieval illuminated manuscripts
    - both the overaching style, and them as actual objects in the place
- ice age engulfed something ("epic fantasy art dump - byPC1eB.jpg")
- non-euclidean like Rorik Smith polyhedral pics or something
- gargantuan statue(s) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Unity) LGD?
- *used*
    + CND - Pageant/parade/procession (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession#Procession_elements)
    + a beautiful metropolis whose divine destruction was averted just moments too late, and is now left frozen in a state of apocalypse, massive eldritch beams coming from the sky, geysers of rubble hovering, etc.
    + Storms

### Relational, Situational, Happenings

- caste systems (LND?)
- the echo - everything you hear or read you know its source, all the way back - LGC, NGD. crystalline psychedelic reverb
- Giant books multiple people to turn page
- the bell ringing hearing contest episode (NGD? dissimulation NND)
- rick & morty arc where there's maybe a clone of beth - one plane could be or have a place where with enough work or luck, you can earn such a clone to take your place. maybe on this plane, a clone is prepared and trained for each person, and almost all go to waste, but some find the plane and take advantage of the clone, and the clone is so happy for the opportunity
- Place where certain maneuvers can temporarily slow or stop time or physical forces in a very localized area
- A caste system signaled by fashion and/or mannerisms
    - Clothing covered with writing/scrolls that catalog some thing <https://78.media.tumblr.com/f5e02ac131c8586071c6a977654b4836/tumblr_nwej2xnuzh1qhslato1_1280.jpg>
- Mnemonic objects - clothing or jewelry records life events (maybe part of caste system above)
- Language/writing
- Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, CNP
- some 3-headed god represents C/P/D all in one? (a simple farmer, 3 headed, 6 armed, see Dattatreya?) but it's a sham. where?
- Resurrection (necromantic or otherwise) - CEC? you can bring dead bodies there and they will likely come to life, but transformed who-knows-how
- Elemental forces (CGP)
- Some creature that responds to Creation and/or Destruction, to be used to test if exposure is too high. Maybe by those wizards that study the planes of pure C/D.
    - from something: "Canaries are extremely sensitive to ambient magic, and will mutate in the presence of cursed architecture. Grave-looters keep them as pets"
- some "breath house" where you breathe in interesting things in special ways (and it responds to you, and syncs up multiple people?) if never used, could be added to LNC promenade for "Arid yet Verdant"?
- psychedelics (CGP)
- "Somewhere in the ocean hundreds of miles north of the Shirerithian mainland there is a mountainous arctic island upon which thrives an emergent oracular techno-theocracy that calls itself the Shining Garden of Raikoth. Its priests wear a silver spiral around their necks as a sign of their dedication, and in solidarity with them I too wear the spiral."
- Some kind of bloodletting ceremony, maybe for summoning, their blood turns into something, after they have gone through some intense emotional experience or something (CGD)
- being scared before beautiful things: "Rainer Maria Rilke proclaimed: ‘beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror’. To put this association to the test, I, together with Kendall Eskine and Natalie Kacinik, psychologists at CUNY, recently conducted another experiment. First, we scared a subset of our respondents by showing them a startling film in which a zombie jumps out on a seemingly peaceful country road. Then we asked all of our subjects to evaluate some abstract, geometric paintings by El Lissitzky. Those subjects who had been startled found the paintings more stirring, inspiring, interesting, and moving" - good for CGD or NGD
- sexual proclivities replace other tribal markers and are increasingly fractured
- many sex partners but only one friend, good form to break up before making another, cheating, etc.
- someone or a group famous for making works of art that convince the viewer to commit suicide. (you must be interviewed first and it's tailored?) (CGP if nowhere else)
- exaltation of poverty
- exercise: weirdtopia: pick a topic, imagine a utopia and dystopia on that topic, then think what weirdtopia would be (appealing but orthogonal)

### Abstract Concepts

- "Some sophists marvel at the dual nature of reality, that for every thing it either *is* or it *isn't*. Marvelous. Well then there are the real thinkers. They say that sometimes a thing *is* **and** it *isn't*. Or that all qualities have a spectrum, ranging from *isn't* all the way to *is*. Or there's a field, some strange topography, multi-dimensional spectra which don't start and end at *isn't* and *is* but go all sorts of other places instead. But they're all backwards. I'll tell you the nature of things. It's very simple. Are you listening? **It neither *is* nor *isn't*.**"
    - did i get this from "It no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not." (Eusebius, quoting Aristocles, quoting Timon describing Pyrrho's views, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrho)

- breaking down all of these needs to be in there https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html maybe LNP or NNC
- formlessness vs EXTREMELY existent
- is total absence of habit freedom? or is it its own kind of tyranny? funes el memorioso is relevant. CXX

- "water always finds a crack" - LND? or LEC LEP LED
- GEB, achilles gets one meta wish, asks for wish not to be granted, and then "an event — or is 'event' the word for it? — takes place which cannot be described, and hence no attempt will be made to describe it." the result is that the universe crashes, and the characters wind up somewhere totally different

        - they "violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."
        - "Many native traditions held clowns and tricksters as essential to any contact with the sacred. People could not pray until they had laughed, because laughter opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred ceremonies for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth."

And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not-Absolute ... is ultimately an illusion"
    - Aestheticism vs [what's the opposite]
        - "does not have any didactic purpose, it need only be beautiful" vs [opposite]
    - Taoism
        - "The focus of Taoism is on the individual within the natural realm rather than the individual within society; accordingly, the goal of life for each individual is seeking to adjust oneself and adapting to the rhythm of the natural (and the supernatural) world, to follow the Way (tao) of the universe, and to live in harmony. ... Politically, Taoism advocates for rule through inaction, and avoiding excessive interference."
    - a Destructive philosophy could take doubts about reality vs perception of reality to an extreme in which the untrusted must go - they maim themselves to remove their senses

        - that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical (as opposed to altruism or utilitarianism)

    - boredom is required for creativity
    - "Consider the incredibly important human value of "boredom" - our desire not to do "the same thing" over and over and over again. You can imagine a mind that contained almost the whole specification of human value, almost all the morals and metamorals, but left out just this one thing ... and so it spent until the end of time, and until the farthest reaches of its light cone, replaying a single highly optimized experience, over and over and over again." --- <http://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile>

At every crossing of threads is an individual, and every individual is a crystal bead.

- "he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all “progressive” thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarized version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people “I offer you a good time,” Hitler has said to them “I offer you struggle, danger and death,” and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." - George Orwell review of Mein Kampf, 1940 - LGC? and/or LGP vs CGP has to deal with this.

Whereto the almighty answered, not displeased.
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
Of thy associates, Adam, and wilt taste
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
What thinkst thou then of me, and this my state,
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness, or not? Who am alone
From all eternity, for none I know
Second to me or like, equal much less.
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the creatures which I made, and those
To me inferior, infinite descents
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
-God to Adam, Paradise Lost, Book VIII 398-411
CNP? something else solitary

All the unaccomplished works of nature's hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
Till final dissolution, wander here,
Not in the neighbouring moon, as some have dreamed;
Those argent fields more likely habitants,
Translated saints, or middle spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind...
-corrupt nature in the void that travesties God's creation, PL Book III 455-62

To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou sayst
leads up to heaven, is both the way and guide;
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;
Love not the heavenly spirits, and how their love
Express they, by looks only, or do they mix
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
-Adam asking Raphael if angels have sex, PL, Book VIII 611-17
(Raphael blushes in response: he "glowed / Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue".  Then gracefully admits they do: "Let it suffice thee that thou knowst / Us happy, and without love no happiness."  Goes on to clarify a little more about the purity of it all.)
