# Writing Style

- karedian: "unusual density, expressiveness, complexity, and precision"
- Few to no made-up words
    - instead the original meaning is simply translated
    - "because every word contains its etymology, many words which others might simply transliterate i have attempted to select a word that captures its meaning. where this is not possible, i have chosen the closest word and added a note"
- don't forget to include undecipherable terms
- are they notes or is it a manuscript? i think incomplete manuscript. include this in translators notes, and then i get to leave stuff as notes!
    + in-universe notes should be marked with indic script bullets
- Switch from florid to very sparse and blunt on occasion.
- There is one writer
- Metric system? TODO does that feel too modern? i've used yards in NNP
- English spelling
- Lists with **bolded headings** that flow in the sentence, not always starting it (see LNC and CND figures/groups)
    + TODO reconcile CND and LNC, maybe change LNC to be more like CND
    + period if complete sentences, otherwise not
    + colons acceptable? used in CND but maybe not
    + LNC: sentences starting with bolded ending in period
    + CND: eh
    + (maybe bold/italic if that looks cool in font)
- From Annals: "Therefore we hope to offer a selection of the consolations we have accrued here and there — evidences of absurdity, charm, eccentricity, joy, virtue, friendship, or unlooked-for luck — that make the road worth traveling despite all."
- present tense when describing things, but past tense when referring to "this visitor" such and such?
- footnotes vs. parentheticals vs. em dashes
    + em dashes: surprise, quirky observations and consequences?
        * describe the detail of a thing
    + parentheticals: technical correctness?
    + footnotes: lengthy versions of either of the above? should personal asides primarly be in footnotes, or is that determined by length?
    + about infinite jest: "pieces of information that are important but not integral. In short, they are remnants of [DFW's] consciousness that he cannot part with"
    + so, they should be sentimental? parentheticals for technical details?
    + footnotes are also "notes and errata"
- capitalization
    + capitalize demonyms
    + capitalize alignments
    + capitalize in-plane groups and places like Scaffold, Procession, Patterners, Tillers
    + capitalize "The" article in plane names? have been NOT, e.g. "the Netherlands" or "the Levant" (although "The Hague" why?)
        * definitely don't capitalize "the". research:
            * offically you capitalize "the" if it's part of the name of the thing, e.g. The New York Times, the move The Untouchables, etc. but for others e.g. the Rockies, the Beatles, the Thames, the Orkneys, the United Kingdom, the Strand, the Bronx, the Hamptons - you don't
            * doing so is a little pretentious?
        * linking
            - wiki doesn't link the "the" in "the Netherlands" - nor does the guardian. that's cause the name of the country is "netherlands". same with the Philippines, not linked, not part of the name. doesn't link in the thames bit it does include "the" in its topic page
            - but does in "the Bronx"
            - so far have been, will continue for now - it's in the title of each page, so
            - if so, should nbsp them or else the tooltip is dumb, or TODO make the tooltip handle this somehow
            - one advantage of not linking is less inline-block/nbsp issues and giant empty spaces
            - don't link in untranslated note, otherwise it'd be straight links
    + prime? so far yes for both Prime planes and Primes as being, Prime-wards, etc.

## Grammatical person

- annals
    - 1st person from annals of the parrigues - no "I" ever?:
        - "When there, do be sure to greet the mine-foreman called Serena the Geologic, an old friend to the authors of the present work."
        - "One of the authors of the present volume here invested in a twill vest. The purchase has proven a valuable investment."
        - "We recommend trying the local specialty..."
        - "Residency When an acquaintance of the authors moved to Minchenbrooke Wells, she received from the neighbors a bud of clover..."
        - "We climbed up and obtained a view of the entire town..."
        - "We stayed up late in Adderfarthing and spent half the night talking about our old friend Edwina Ballard. It is a consolation, when you are far from home and in a strange place, and especially when some local trouble threatens to catch up with you, to remember people far away who are completely detached from your present concerns. We were certain, when we woke the next morning in Adderfarthing, and carried our bags away from Ostrich and Fingerroot, that no one was following us, and that there weren’t any rumors about us, and that no one was whispering *Parrigue, Parrigue* from doorways when we went by. But even supposing we are wrong, we have our notes, and our guidebook, our acquaintance in many lands, an ivory and chalcedony figurine of the King under the Mountain (with his face covered in a swatch of vegetable silk), a purse of gold coins, a bottle of anise liqueur; and a contract registered in Lost Drinchham that says we cannot be made to betray each other, not even at the hands of the law."
        - "Concerning Emport’s provisions we have nothing to say^[My co-author means to indicate by this that there was an accident that destroyed all of her notes for Emport. She regrets this extremely, but there is nothing that can now be done.]."
        - so and so "claimed to recognize one of the authors, but she responded that they were not acquainted" - maybe somewhere where EVERYBODY seems to recognize one of the authors, this was assumed to be a trait of the plane, but didn't happen to anyone else, so... make of it what you will
    - 2nd person from Annals - often 3rd person (singular or plural), but rarely or never "one"
        - "It's not easy to get to and from... your best hope is to persuade..."
        - "Those wishing to take up residency..."
        - "A dedicated traveler would..."
        - "If you are a frequent traveler—as we suppose most of those reading this book must be—then you may..."
        - "If you are lucky, you may be able to"
        - i think there's also "reader," can i use this? maybe. (used in LNC promenade of congruities)
- use 2nd person freely, also 1st person plural to mean author and reader/others
    + so, rarely "one"? would it be weird to go back and forth? i guess instead of "one" use "a visitor" etc.
    + have used "you might wonder"
    + yeah default to "you"
- use "we" only for
    + the most general sense ("we mortals", "gods as we know them")
    + maybe: "we" as in the reader and the writer, as in "as we have discussed..."? haven't used yet i think
- 3rd person gender neutral used everywhere, that okay?
- "the present work", "this work", to refer to her stuff

# Author

- Name - Alea?
- Predictions that come true or repeat. What same thing could keep showing up on different lamina that's more about her than the multiverse?
    + doppelganger?!
        * they are usually bad omens
        * footnotes "it was here this visitor had her first encounter with her laminal doppelganger"
        * unclear if just for her or in general
        * or maybe, like goethe story (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger#Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe), some premonition of herself that later accidentally comes true in some looped way
    + maybe cursed for having the conduit
    + maybe sees/manifests her dead brother
        * i guess she'd be looking for him?!
- how tough is she? e.g. facing the CEC kids.
    + gracious, self-controlled, clever
- travelling with a companion somewhere, maybe with consequences?
    + maybe met someone in the Bell, or the Inevitability
- pick one plane that the annals of of the parrigues could take place in, and then:
    + "it was here that this visitor picked up a book called The Annals of the Parrigues describing the area and, though she had been traveling for some time already, it was this book that persuaded her to turn her notes and journals into the work you are now reading, and to which she owes some small stylistic debt for having been granted by it the liberty to occasionally interject her experiences into these pages."
    + actually it would be better if she actually meets them, maybe they just completed the book, gave her a bottle of anise liqueur. describe the couple, clearly at the end of a long journey and glowing with experience and still-growing affection for each other
- example from nyt goop article. gp talks about 3rd child, writer says she later cried. then later in article she describes a session of self doubt that involves her lack of 3rd child. it's clear that that's when she cried
    - maybe could be like at some post-painful beautiful moment "it was later, when this visitor realized that she would never again be setting foot in any of the laminal realms again, that all the collected stress and beauty of her years of travel would flow through her in a flood of tears" and then later you see the what and why of why she has to never step foot in them again.
- there's something special about "the next day..." with a forward-looking commentary for the ending. "years later..." tries to do the same thing but it's not immediate enough, and we already have a "years later" in the frame story.
- "...its priests wear a silver spiral around their necks as a sign of their dedication, and in solidarity with them I too [now] wear the spiral." from slate star codex thing
- the ivory pendant she has in frame frontmatter - change and/or connect to plot
- the soblei bead map - does she give it away?
- favorite spot candidates:
    + the islet
    + echo plateau
    + bell duh
    + maybe NGD cathartic ritual

> descriptive moral relativism holds only that people do, in fact, disagree fundamentally about what is moral, with no judgment being expressed on the desirability of this. Meta-ethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is objectively right or wrong. Normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, everyone ought to tolerate the behavior of others

i don't think her position should be that "no one is right or wrong"... but then what?

### back story

*sheltered royalty who aided genocide and then self-exiled herself to wander, in her wanderings she met with the "enemy" and they were fine and it destroyed her worldview, receded into delirium. at the Bell (i.e. some entheogen) (maybe this was well into her laminal journey) she realized that ~if we could all just work together and see how we need each other~ it'd be great, and so she decided to try to engineer a foundational myth for her culture that would find a place for all kinds of people, but parable-izing how going hard in one way won't work.*

so she planned to return to her people. did she? how'd it work out? she'd have to like disseminate it. maybe everything had changed by the time she got back and she wasn't welcome, and so her personal quest ended. she came to terms with it in NGP or NGD or echo plateau.

maybe the genocide split her family, like her younger brother sided with the peasants, and wanted to escape with her, but instead she let him get executed for it.

early thoughts: daughter of a noble who left, buddha like, to journey and leave it all behind, maybe after a civil war. absolutely no combat nor magic skills or anything. if she had stats, they would all be... str 9, dex 11, con 13, cha 13, int 11, wis 15. no rpg class.

journeyed her whole life but spend lots of time in some of these places, in at least once she considered living forever there because she loved it, but she didn't want to fall prey to dogmatism, this work would remain incomplete if she had stayed, but she considered it because the lamina suited her (NGP or NGC/Bell?)

she had a formative experience with some political strife that led her to want to convince people that these political absolutes belong to the laminae only (where they are perpetuated by natural forces and semi-no-free-will'd people) but that on cardinal worlds we must cOexIsT. a world with just sheep or wolves wouldn't work, except a superatural one.

keep in mind that the Bell's Universal Story is partly responsible for the work??

- not just a female-gendered male character
- possible objectives:
    + no good or evil, everyone makes sense in their context
    + and no one paradigm works for everything
        * although that's what Synthesis and Utility say. but likewise in practice you can't adhere to either of those dogmatically, sometimes an extreme is needed?
    + exploration, wonder, research
    + finding a home
    + fixing something - tracking down a family member, righting a wrong that someone (maybe herself) did
- why is she writing this?
    + sharing knowledge
    + more existential, like this is the nature of reality
    + maybe also like "understand all types of beings"
        * maybe was caught up in (or helped create) a conflict, and was totally humbled, and wants to learn and help prevent it from happening again
            - conflict could have involved not understanding what a lamina was for
        * "the universe takes all types of people"
    + atonement
        * she grew up dogmatic and sheltered in a royal family and participated in their evil deeds that felt good to her and were driven by perception of evil others
        * civil war ensued, she was cast out, revelation when meeting the other side
        * inspired her to write this fiction, and it took off
- i can see her spreading word of laminae to different laminae
- does she have ties to a community? she did but it got pretty fucked up
- personality traits
    + humble, funny/amused, listens, regal, simple, kind, accepted by everyone, absolutely no expectations from anything ever
    + does she overflow with empathy for everything or is she cool-headed?
        * maybe the former in most of her life, and her journey brought her to the latter?
- her fate and fate of her work
    + some aperture gone wrong, or maybe emergency exit from The Cartography
    + no time stuff, rather she got suspended in some stasis for a long time and the Order unlocked it
    + another copy had been made before this happened, and/or someone (an Inevitability visitor?) made a copy? maybe at the archive (LNP)
- royalty - some chosen class leading a theocratic state - hence liturgical karedian?

### moments

- in detail above:
    + Parrigues
    + crying/self-doubt
    + finds a companion
- parrigues: "claimed to recognize one of the authors, but she responded that they were not acquainted" - maybe somewhere where EVERYBODY seems to recognize one of the authors, this was assumed to be a trait of the plane, but didn't happen to anyone else, so... make of it what you will
- the conduit
- she helps resolve some laminal dispute
- on echo plateau or NGD or CGD she gives up looking for her brother, and/or where she forgave herself
    + "it was here that this visitor formally gave up on the cause that began her journey" eh
- a slip up where she reveals that it's fictional
    + like "but this visitor couldn't think of a more plausible outcome for this lamina"
    + this visitor's imagination couldn't...
    + maybe translator's note calls attention to it, translates it as something more plausible but gives alternate that makes you question
    + relevant idioms
        *
- it was here that this visitor realized the cultural flaw---bad stories---that led to her self-exile, and decided to work to set it right - LEC or LEP?
- author having an argument with someone over something, mentioned say in footnote
- one plane, fairly late on, "it was through this aperture that this visitor first set foot in one of the laminae"
- also fairly late, a simple note that this is this visitor's favorite spot in the multiverse - maybe it has to do as much with relief from something really difficult. coming out of the cave in spain, a fire.
- one spot where she spends a very very long time, nearly retired from traveling.
    + but then this work would be incomplete and she'd fall prey to the same dogmatism etc etc
    + promises to go back there in the end
- this visitor was honored to be invited to participate in [such and such ceremony], though of course she was not permitted in the [special place]
- something omitted for it would not reflect well upon this visitor LEC?
- close call (maybe somewhere not particularly dangerous). It was here, of all places, that this visitor came closest to mortal harm, when a ____
- more beauty - some busy activity in a beautiful place, the beauty makes the time stop, maybe LGP
    + And then it turned again, and suddenly we were on a street ablaze with cherry trees in luxuriant, excessive bloom. There they were, a dozen on each side of the street, all of them shaggy with flowers, the air around them swarming with floating petals, as if the petals were affixing themselves to the branches. Beneath and around them were everyday people doing everyday things, the tasks that need to be completed if a great city is to function: A delivery truck was being unloaded, and the sidewalk was being swept, and a repairman was shimmying up a telephone pole, and a woman was dragging a wooden crate of what might have been daikon to the door of a soba-ya. It was comical and also unbelievable, as if above them the skies were busy with flying pigs, and no one had noticed. This was a plain, unremarkable street, but in that moment, it was the most beautiful in Japan. It made me wonder whether it wasn’t good fortune after all that the sakura season was so brief, for, these people aside, how could anyone get anything done in the face of such splendor? Wasn’t it miraculous that life didn’t simply cease in those two weeks in April that the trees were in bloom? How could you concentrate on anything else? How could a human compete?
- show kindness, show listening, show humility
    + "as is customary, this visitor left an offering..." NGD or CGD
    + did not wish to bother, but made space for her bedroll...
    + apologizing genuinely for breaking some norm, and then speaking to the offended person for a long time about it, understanding

### First person terms

Always just one? Maybe joined by someone briefly.

- this visitor - a little otherworldly so that's cool, like not just traveling but visiting, humble
- this traveler - kind of... nicer? but also more boring
- your traveler - personal in a pleasant way, calls attention every time
- NO
    - your visitor (not visiting the reader)
    - your correspondent (the economist)
    - this wanderer (too fluffy)
    - this explorer (too grand, not humble enough)
- this guest (maybe sometimes?)

What about when multiple references are nearby? like CND Procession Shape, footnote

examples:

- More than once this visitor was excitedly regaled with a story of one design associate who...
- Some Architects this visitor has spoken with about this refer vaguely to...
- What struck this visitor most was the contrast between the inexorable and graceful movements of active wind shifters, and the awful stillness of their constructed echoes on the plateau.
- Reader, The Unfolding is resplendent with masterpieces, but walking the full length of this promenade left this visitor blind with wonder.
- ... and some have apparently turned to backtrack from here. This visitor however had traded her...
- Beholding the wanton crowd, your traveler searched and found no malice

when decided, update the frame story

### Foci (high-ish priority?)

e.g. entropy, architecture, the bloom's mutation, the universal story

TODO go through evil sketch

(move from above and below into here)

23 of them!

- terrapin (is it an archive/library/museum or more sensorium? could be both)
- something pretty futuristic, but not described as such
- they worship a god who is crazy but they love it
- war? a thousand-mile-wide battlefield populated by warring soldiers from every era throughout history XEX
- something where everything is like a play, or all interactions are formulaic - NGP probably
    + like a drama?
    + greek stock characters/jungian archetypes etc
    + and/or where you are assigned a ritual role in a play, and learning that role is therapeutic - NGC?
        * Like thinking about how an actor with a very short role might still deeply flesh out history and mindset of char to play it well. It goes deeper
- "an indigenous Amazonian society that shifted seasonally between two entirely different forms of social organization (small, authoritarian nomadic bands during the dry months; large, consensual horticultural settlements during the rainy season)"
- some valuable resource intruders want to use...
- looking for the chosen one - in an interesting way
    + "I could make a good argument for it being an emergent phenomenon. The prophecy might go: "A society of this structure in this environment will inevitably produce a hero of this character. When you see him, don't murder him. Help him along." It's still birth lottery, but shared." https://twitter.com/AaronPogue/status/1444289931162103808
    + society-wide processes to breed out chosen people/breed - this is bene gesserit right?
    + LEX? maybe LEC
    + rilke quote (?)
- society that glamorizes maintenance instead of creation? LGP
- death? CGD
- glitch: the only way to know something is by knowing how it breaks, and everything breaks in a way that's unique to the thing. NND or NED or LED or LND. - and then how it heals
- two planes that have something to say about the presence or absence of free will - perhaps both planes work in the exact same way, but in one the action is taken as an argument for free will and in the other the action is taken as an argument for determinism - probably LXX and corresponding CXX
- One where she finds the Annals of the Parrigues - some library, or some place connected to a cardinal world?
- One should be extremely short (maybe no or very few known residents?)
    - like "_____ appears to be a complicated place, but thanks to the efforts of the Forgetful Duke, it all seems rather simple once you've left."
    - CED
- Which is the most populous? LGC? Would be good for LGC's character but prob doesn't make sense that most people are that. Maybe LGP. Might not be about which alignment most people are, but how well the plane keeps petitioners around?
- Generation ship - high-tech-low-tech caravan across 100,000 mile desert - why? hoping to find the end. how: aperture travels with them. XXD - LED or NED? NGD you join for ritual. prob LED or at least NED cause it requires a system to sustain itself. all else fails could be on CNP. what about CGD? brackish swamp
    - if not "hoping to find the end" then would be XXP
    - interesting stuff about maintaining morale on endless journey, does that work with finding the end? i guess some could give up, maybe there are some scattered communities
    - generation ship aspect needs inhospitability of space vs spaceship vs finding a planet, so this would need something like that, caravan provides something
- magical research outpost, maybe in CNC or CGC. this is kind of Bloom islet
- One where you sense branching tree of possibilities, rick & morty death stone, fading and increasing options as you move (NNC, LGD, CNC)
- Some kind of mirroring or doppelgangering in the way it responds to you
    + james richardson vectors (see in quotes) "You who have proved how much like me you are: how could I trust you?" some kind of doppelganger thing
    + maybe weirdly LGC? NGD, CGD, LEC, LEP, NEC, CEP, CNC, CGC
    + *definitely NGD if nothing else* - maybe CEP
    + do you learn from it? does it scare you?
- saying yes vs. saying no
    + LND or CNP is no?
    + CNC and CNP make a good yes/no pair
    + 'The afterlife is comprised of two territories: not heaven and hell, but a world for those who said "yes" more than "no", and its opposite. Yes-world is flowing, a realm without boundaries, and of your soul it makes a river and a flux, a joyful playdough being that absorbs all it touches. No-world is a sequence of diamond-walled gardens, and from safety you watch beautiful terrors flicker through the crystal' <https://twitter.com/ctrlcreep/status/1100085668397699073> ('But what if I had to spend my life mostly saying yes against my will')
    - maybe this is in cosmography, someone went to exactly 2 planes and then said the above, lead the way into figuring out about there being more - CNC vs CNP
- Some destructiveness focusing on sloth/inertia - activity is actively punished, but in the laziest way possible. If too proactively punishing, the punishment is punished. maybe CED or LED or CNP
- Lost and found (maybe in CEC or CNC or LNP) (maybe connected through some weird backdoor to the storage plane?) (i guess CND too, maybe a rumor of a lost objects troupe you can sometimes find stuff in)
- All beings part of a single collective hive intelligence (OR it's not clear whether everyone is part of a single crazy chaotic mind, or are actually different minds) - should probably be NXX, would be interesting autonomy CXX, maybe NEC, CNC, CEC, CGC. gosh could be NGD if nothing else
    - https://twitter.com/TylerAlterman/status/1453671384186564610
    - "Something the whole ocean is doing"
- Two sides that have ritual border. Ceremonies about hating each other, but they never actually fight (two walls place?) NED?
- Sex  - CGD, CED, NED, NEC (dreams), NEP
- a prison (w research/testing?)
- non-euclidean/visual distortion like Rorik Smith polyhedral pics or something (NNC?)
- sleep NEC
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#In_mythology_and_literature
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sleepers
- strange loops
    + Synthesis facet. relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP?
- weirdly insensitive and/or literally stupid, but powerful. XXD - NED, CGD
- bureaucracy? LEP or LED or LND
    + belgium
        * "Whereas other countries suffer from a “computer says no” attitude, Belgium has artisan bureaucrats, who can make obstacles appear or disappear at a whim. No two interactions with a Belgian official are the same. In this way, a surplus of bureaucracy leads to anarchy rather than conformity"
        * "Belgium offers a lesson in stability through chaos. Even its demise would be serene. It is the world’s most successful failed state."
        * https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/06/24/belgitude-the-art-of-belgian-zen
- transportation: they'll take you anywhere, ferriers, psychopomps (could go with generation ship, "come aboard, we're going where you're going")
- secret society so secret and/or went wrong such that no one could get back into it (LND?)
- two (or more) totally separate societies (NED war + ritual athletes?)
- used
    + incredible beauty
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_method
    + an infinite jest (/burning man/blockchain/lsd)-inspired thing, something where everyone annoyingly loves it, raves, but it's actually good and changes your ife
    + Something ridiculously hazardous
    + Restorative justice destination
    + oral history that means stuff only to the initiated
    + eschaton godhead approaching
    + Pure experience/observation
    + mutatorium
    + the echo - everything you hear or read you know its source, all the way back. crystalline psychedelic reverb
    + pain/torture
        * torturers are split in the way LGP and CGP are split - whether pleasure is required for utmost torture or if pure pain will suffice. Pleasure provides more tools, such as rewarding victims with sex or abatement of pain for them doing things that make them despise themselves. One clique or torturer is famous for inflicting BSG Cavil on people.

### Physical, Environmental, Aesthetic

unused ones can just be particular places

- in the clouds of a gas giant - built on trees that take root?
- incredibly loud, but quiet eye of the storm in the middle
- huge building constructed with a single piece of gossamer fabric
- More extreme weather and how it effects culture - like it always rains, but weirder
- Sort of like the wall place, one place could be an endless crevasse
    + maybe 100 feet across (need to conceptualize it - tennis court?) so daylight is limited (very, it would converge to block out all light unless plane's geometry is differnt, or it slopes outwards? maybe slopes out and never seems to increase in distance), especially if the people above you have many bridged buildings..infinitely tall and deep. maybe there's one area only where the distance varies - like an amphitheater. a city used to be there but now there is only a lone demon - LED, NEP, NED

    - in Roman Saturnalia, masters and slaves feasted together, or masters provided table service for slaves, also a time for free speech where slaves could say anything
- Cemetery/necropolis (same as prison plane?)

    + Pageant/parade/procession (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession#Procession_elements)
    + a beautiful metropolis whose divine destruction was averted just moments too late, and is now left frozen in a state of apocalypse, massive eldritch beams coming from the sky, geysers of rubble hovering, etc.
    + Storms
    + single infinite wall
    + Endless river delta
    + Black desert (and its oases!)
    + stelae (carved stone slabs)
    + No "ground" is known, but this realm is laid out as a lattice of gnarled and winding mostly-horizontal projections of rock. Crags and massive plateaus give way to tendrils of stone sometimes no thicker

### Relational, Situational, Happenings

- headsoak note 440 about genius king who is afraid of not being heard, entertained by his retinue of scholars, and the decay of this microculture (LND? LEP?)
- some kind of transportation system? mechanical or biological. LNP?
- the conception of perfection. (look up quotes?)
    + That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. nothing to add, nothing to take away
- nomads, who every X amount of time ritualistically destroy everything they have built up and move on to another place - XXP or XXD
- <gpt>The ruins of an ancient civilization. The inhabitants share their ancestors’ obsession with perfecting a single simulation of a city, endlessly adapting it to reflect new scientific, cultural, and social insights.</gpt>
- "a nice dualism: those who are afraid, and those who are not. the fearful ones are prey. they hate life because they could be eaten at any time, they are disgusted with material reality and their bodies because of their impermanence. the unafraid embrace matter and love their bodies, capable of the magical feat of integrating the prey's matter. there is no higher honor and no better statement of love for life than to absorb another being. some may call this hate, but it may be love. these are the ground rules of reality. you can always change sides" - https://twitter.com/wildbuddhini/status/1463392393978335239 (maybe LEC)
- interaction with cardinals? "person with taste can observe things going on around them and identify points of interest. by doing this, they make the reality they inhabit more interesting. you can create real value this way. it has an emotional impact on people. you might use words, or photographs, whatever. you could maybe think of this as being a "beauty-worker". you create beauty by identifying it, contemplating it, understanding it, accentuating it .if a shaman is a meaning-worker, maybe an artist is a beauty-worker. or a certain subset of artists" - https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1464230021254377475 LEC?
- "new identity idea: asane (as opposed to insane). not crazy, just renouncing and revoking sanity Relieved face" https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1463771414830325761
- Audience independent utterance - the idealization of
- Emotional etc content of micro actions? (NGP?)
- "a massive chunk of the things that alarm suburbanites about being in an urban environment are solved in totality by adopting the city dweller's habit of simply declining to perceive things that are none of your fucking business" https://twitter.com/cakesandcourage/status/1462919432330752006 - somewhere where this flows naturally, maybe LEP?
- some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? eh
- caste systems (LND? LEC LEP) mentioned in LEC and in TOC but doesn't have to be major there
    + signaled by fashion and/or mannerisms
        * Clothing covered with writing/scrolls that catalog some thing ("worn scrolls.jpg")
- "That which thinks is bound, and in this bondage, it dreams of freedom. And like a prisoner in his dreams he can see the walls of his prison, and he can imagine the outside world. But when he wakes, he still sees the walls of the prison and has not escaped." - https://mobile.twitter.com/gods_txt/status/1456321077710241792 LED NED or even CNP
- No decisions except gut ones during ceremonies. Very elaborate, no time to scheme. More authentic. They facilitate this method for mortals. Like Dune emperor emissary delivers decree, obey or disobey on the spot, only way to cut through (and assess loyalty, and instinct). the sufis "believe that deep intuition is the only real guide to knowledge". human computer. fluency before understanding (quote?). NGP if nowhere else, but could be LXX
- https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1458552157179887621 - grokking, you have to understand your enemy to defeat them, and when you understand them you love them. also you need to love them to hate them. NND?
- "bats can hear shapes. plants can eat light. bees can dance maps. we can hold all these ideas at once and feel both heavy and weightless with the absurd beauty of it all." - https://twitter.com/gnonymus/status/1457089729539842050
- Sleep is assumed to be death, a new spirit will take your body in the morning. reincarnation somewhere in this?
- "Mental Health Unawareness Campaigns" that stress takes publicized forms, so here's some alternative form
- Giant books multiple people to turn page
- the bell ringing hearing contest episode (dissimulation NND)
- rick & morty arc where there's maybe a clone of beth - one plane could be or have a place where with enough work or luck, you can earn such a clone to take your place. maybe on this plane, a clone is prepared and trained for each person, and almost all go to waste, but some find the plane and take advantage of the clone, and the clone is so happy for the opportunity (NNC)
- Place where certain maneuvers can temporarily slow or stop time or physical forces in a very localized area
- Deaf/mute (or everyone is missing one sense) - could be any D, maybe NGD, CGD, CNP, NED, LED
    + maybe some other perception issue
    + the "three perfections" - a poet, a calligrapher, and a painter, for chinese artwork. multiple sense-missing people get together to create something
- someone who has one squad each of blind, deaf, numb, untasting/unsmelling guards. (maybe the deaf ones close by, so the villain can converse privately. maybe the blind ones near all the entrances). or rather guilds, each petitioner must relinquish one sense. maybe NND, LEP
- some 3-headed god represents C/P/D all in one? (a simple farmer, 3 headed, 6 armed, see Dattatreya?) but it's a sham. where?
- Resurrection (necromantic or otherwise) - CEC? you can bring dead bodies there and they will likely come to life, but transformed who-knows-how
- Some creature that responds to Creation and/or Destruction, to be used to test if exposure is too high. Maybe by those wizards that study the planes of pure C/D.
    - from something: "Canaries are extremely sensitive to ambient magic, and will mutate in the presence of cursed architecture. Grave-looters keep them as pets"
- some "breath house" where you breathe in interesting things in special ways (and it responds to you, and syncs up multiple people?) if never used, stub-used in NGP
- psychedelics (CGP)
- "Somewhere in the ocean hundreds of miles north of the Shirerithian mainland there is a mountainous arctic island upon which thrives an emergent oracular techno-theocracy that calls itself the Shining Garden of Raikoth. Its priests wear a silver spiral around their necks as a sign of their dedication, and in solidarity with them I too wear the spiral."
- sexual proclivities replace other tribal markers and are increasingly fractured
- many sex partners but only one friend, good form to break up before making another, cheating, etc.
- someone or a group famous for making works of art that convince the viewer to commit suicide. (you must be interviewed first and it's tailored?) (CGP if nowhere else - CGD LED NED)
- exaltation of poverty
- exercise: weirdtopia: pick a topic, imagine a utopia and dystopia on that topic, then think what weirdtopia would be (appealing but orthogonal)
    + requirement that everyone go through some kind of educational gauntlet (like the sexual weirdtopia at <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia#nbGkPXNEDm856igNg>)
    + sex ed: everyone tries everything and then chooses what they're into
    + a failed free love and sex world, because "taboo is revealed to be as fundamental aspect of sexual arousal as the unknown is to the intellectual. The people demand a strict morality police after an era of total acceptance drains all the fun out of it. Everyone is fully expected to both seek out sexual thrills and aid in the swift punishment of anyone who seeks out sexual thrills"
    + "Governmental Weirdtopia" <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia#ffxHS6LNtBYo5cudN>
        + "Yearly presidents are chosen at random. (couldn't be worse than our current system) The catch is that the person chosen to be the leader has absolutely no idea that they are the leader. They are followed around and monitored, and anything uttered resembling a decree is put into action if it doesn't violate the constitution. The decrees are only put into place after their term expires so they don't catch on. Quick decision-making such as treaties are wars are left up to a streamlined unicameral legislative body."
    + "Because of the end of scarcity, the economic roles of production and consumption have switched; wealth is now acquired by consuming, and producers pay consumers to use their goods or services. The right to make something is highly coveted and prestigious, and producing without a customer is illegal and severely punished." <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia#gkAPnw9FmXn8ZHSPo>
    + there is some oracle that knows what's "best" for every action in its domain - you're free to listen to it or not. "Everyone is free to listen to The Computer or not, but you know that your decision would be less efficient for accomplishing your goals. Such rebellions are useless, however, because The Computer's prediction capabilities include whether or not you will take its advice, and it acts accordingly to make sure you get the best results anyway."
- symbiotic creatures groom and pick things off you, but not physical stuff, something else, emotional/dreams too easy, but they live off of it? there's some efficiency here. don't stay too long or it's too much? CGD and it's sexual? very intimate. inside a flower
- Some kind of bloodletting ceremony, maybe for summoning, their blood turns into something, after they have gone through some intense emotional experience or something - tentative NGD but without summoning bit
- seeking out a state of "unknowing"
    + 'all thoughts and desires under a "cloud of forgetting," and thereby piercing God's cloud of unknowing with a "dart of longing love" from the heart... "For He can well be loved, but he cannot be thought." ... "And so I urge you, go after experience rather than knowledge"'
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloud_of_Unknowing
- empty mind, empty conscience - some kind of small brain everything is easier if you just think nothing oblivion situation - is this already NND?
- some crazy education process for new petitioners
    + like lesswrong weirdtopia comment where you work your way through simulation of human civilization learning everything
    + NGC could do this for Universal Story
- used
    + Mnemonic objects - clothing or jewelry records life events (could be part of caste system above but it's not) - used in NGP but could maybe be moved elsewhere if perfect
    + Epiphanies (place where you have them)
    + place where you can swap lives
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_flooding
    + Elemental forces (where?)
    + unusual language element
    + "Rather than classical "good health," fashionable people sculpt their bodies into interesting shapes with the help of highly specific and commonly-performed exercises prescribed by regimen-planning software." <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia#WZCDyzJxnPweLEH6Z>

### Abstract Concepts

- "retinal" art, intended only to please the eye. Instead, Duchamp wanted to use art to serve the mind.
- "you: human creativity is an glorious, nigh-divine faculty / me: a human brain is a puncture wound in the fabric of reality that monsters from outside the world can use to claw their way into it / we are not the same" - https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1469396883118477316
- "Some sophists marvel at the dual nature of reality, that for every thing it either *is* or it *isn't*. Marvelous. Well then there are the real thinkers. They say that sometimes a thing *is* **and** it *isn't*. Or that all qualities have a spectrum, ranging from *isn't* all the way to *is*. Or there's a field, some strange topography, multi-dimensional spectra which don't start and end at *isn't* and *is* but go all sorts of other places instead. But they're all backwards. I'll tell you the nature of things. It's very simple. Are you listening? **It neither *is* nor *isn't*.**"
    - did i get this from "It no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not." (Eusebius, quoting Aristocles, quoting Timon describing Pyrrho's views, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrho)
    - full passage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism#Buddhism
- breaking down all of these needs to be in there https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html maybe LNP or NNC
- formlessness vs EXTREMELY existent
- is total absence of habit freedom? or is it its own kind of tyranny? funes el memorioso is relevant. CXX
- realm outside of cause-and-effect? maybe lawful or neutral somehow? LEP maybe
- "water always finds a crack" - LND or LED
- GEB, achilles gets one meta wish, asks for wish not to be granted, and then "an event — or is 'event' the word for it? — takes place which cannot be described, and hence no attempt will be made to describe it." the result is that the universe crashes, and the characters wind up somewhere totally different

    - trickster:
        - boundary crossing, bending/breaking rules, boasting, thieving, lying, gender/form variability, reader invited to laugh and admire ingenuity
        - they "violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis."
        - "Many native traditions held clowns and tricksters as essential to any contact with the sacred. People could not pray until they had laughed, because laughter opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred ceremonies for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth."

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition - selection of officials as random sample from larger pool (maybe everyone)
    - trifunctional hypothesis: priests, warriors, and commoners (the sacral or sovereign, the martial and the economic) - what about political/bureaucratic, are they the priests?
    - School of "Minor-talks"
        - an ancient Chinese system in which "there were some government officials responsible for collecting ideas from non-famous people on the street and report to their senior"
        - some plane could collect and report on theories of specifically chosen (according to seemingly random, truly random, or arbitrarily specific rubrics) people around the multiverse, and then take them very very seriously  - the result is pretty nonsensical
        - maybe combine with some kid of wacky moral absolutism
    - Anarcho-primitivism
        - "shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. They advocate a return to non-'civilized' ways of life"

    - Aestheticism vs [what's the opposite]

    - Taoism

Politically, Taoism advocates for rule through inaction, and avoiding excessive interference."
    - a Destructive philosophy could take doubts about reality vs perception of reality to an extreme in which the untrusted must go - they maim themselves to remove their senses

- "he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all “progressive” thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarized version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people “I offer you a good time,” Hitler has said to them “I offer you struggle, danger and death,” and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." - George Orwell review of Mein Kampf, 1940 - LGC? and/or LGP vs CGP has to deal with this. LEP tho?
- "Humans don’t mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel necessary." ― Sebastian Junger (CGP? LEP?) [a society that perfects the art of making people feel unnecessary will crumble]

- rilke quote about god coming
    + Why don’t you think of him as the one who is coming, who has been approaching from all eternity, the one who will someday arrive, the ultimate fruit of a tree whose leaves we are? What keeps you from projecting his birth into the ages that are coming into existence, and living your life as a painful and lovely day in the history of a great pregnancy? Don’t you see how everything that happens is again and again a beginning, and couldn’t it be His beginning, since, in itself, starting is always so beautiful? If he is the most perfect one, must not what is less perfect precede him, so that he can choose himself out of fullness and superabundance? Must he not be the last one, so that he can include everything in himself, and what meaning would we have if he whom we are longing for has already existed?
    + As bees gather honey, so we collect what is sweetest out of all things and build Him. Even with the trivial, with the insignificant (as long as it is done out of love) we begin, with work and with the repose that comes afterward, with a silence or with a small solitary joy, with everything that we do alone, without anyone to join or help us, we start Him whom we will not live to see, just as our ancestors could not live to see us. And yet they, who passed away long ago, still exist in us, as predisposition, as burden upon our fate, as murmuring blood, and as gesture that rises up from the depths of time.

    + "So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloudshadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that something is happening with you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand; it will not let you fall.

Whereto the almighty answered, not displeased.
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
Of thy associates, Adam, and wilt taste
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
What thinkst thou then of me, and this my state,
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness, or not? Who am alone
From all eternity, for none I know
Second to me or like, equal much less.
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the creatures which I made, and those
To me inferior, infinite descents
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
---God to Adam, Paradise Lost, Book VIII 398-411
CNP? something else solitary

All the unaccomplished works of nature's hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
Till final dissolution, wander here,

Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war.

# Macros

## <gpt>GPT-3 text</gpt>

how to handle multi-paragraph, especially if it starts in the middle? if not forming a single unit, can simply separately <gpt>mark off</gpt> each paragraph/bit


## TODO

- remove TODOs and replace with brackets
    - e.g. `TODO/blah (blah blah) [something]` (spaces optional)
- format for converting TODOs to fragments (perhaps unclear translations)
    - simple `TODO/thing (details)` should be like "can't make it out"
    - how to handle "reword this"?
        - if passable, make sure TODO is contained and can be removed harmlessly
        - if not possible, different format to replace with "passage unreadable"
            - or html comments if it shouldn't be included at all
    - for big missing pieces, present stubs as incompletely translated ("editors note: this chapter has not yet been translated, but to our understanding it...")
        - one of them can be like "this is totally incoherent?"

## ____

something that needs filling once figured out

`____(note)[replacement for now]`

`____[replacement for now]`

check others maybe no brackets just cut out

for now, some can be just removed, others...? search and see

## SKIP

skip entire section up to the next equal or higher heading (is this used??)
