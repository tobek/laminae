summary: An endless cliff face, with no known ground or top or sides, into which the Grains have quarried for aeons as they craft and sculpt and adjust essential creations for introduction into cardinal worlds.

intro: |

    In the workshops of the Asymmetry all the essential forms of reality have been hewn and sculpted and forged, in great open chambers set into a cliff face with no known ground or top or sides. It is simply a wall facing an empty sky, and into the fruitful earth of this wall Grains quarry ever deeper for materials for their creations that will eventually be delivered into nature or the minds or hands of mortals.

    Grains believe deeply that nothing is perfectly symmetrical, for even if an object is itself symmetrical, its environment is not, and no object can be considered outside of its environment. And so in any pursuit of symmetry with the environment in total, an object must itself be asymmetrical, further complicating the whole. Despite the impossibility of perfect balance, Grains are forever pursuing the act of balancing: introducing new animals or tools---even new philosophies or deities---to cardinal worlds in order to tweak and understand discrepancies in the shape of things.

    The endless wall of the Asymmetry is composed of all manner of substance, from metals and ores and every consistency of earth to pockets of embers and rivulets of water, and on the cliff face itself grow trees and fruits in vertical latticed orchards. Over aeons caverns and interconnected tunnels have been bored to incredible depths, and in the myths of Grains there is another side to the wall that will eventually be reached, full of new forms of matter and a community of brethren from which they were separated in primordial times.

what's the point?

Some believe the gods themselves---some of them, all of them, who knows?---were painstakingly sculpted in these forges. They'll make anything but keep careful ledger so that the output of the plane remains balanced. Every thing created is forecast to have certain effects, and miscalculations are rapidly accounted for. They are famous employers (famously rewarding, famously exacting) of explorers and researchers who report back to them on the results of their more ambitious or uncertain endeavors. It's said that these mercenaries are chosen very, very carefully. Often the act of investigation itself and those chosen to investigate are meant to fix any imbalances, and surprisingly often the investigators themselves find their own nature changed in the process.

many more things are made than are released - why/how? not sure

## Environment

### The Wall

- A single giant wall, no ground or top (is there secretly a top?) two sides but no way to get from one to other - no one has dug far enough. people talk mythically about "the other side". but since it's infinite, two places too far apart to be reached on foot/climbing, how do you know they're not on the same side? people have attempted to map it out but many locations still haven't been connected
    - if there is a top (or bottom) it should be sheared off absolutely flat like a glitch in a video game
