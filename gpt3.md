**The Unravellers of The Inevitability joyously manifest the forces of entropy, that universal and implacable slide from order into disorder. Troupes each pursue their own flavors of entropy: rotting food, aging, combustion, romantic miscommunication, broken furniture, political dissolution, and myriad others.

Certain individuals are so distinctive, venerable, and skilled as to be treated by locals and visitors alike as demigods of their domains. These Unravellers possess to an alarmingly magnified degree the same entropic aura which in their brethren only delicately guides nature along its course. Around these powers minor calamities unfold as appropriate to each one’s influence: clothing tears, food turns sour, thoughts derail.

Here are some demigod Unravellers and their entropic domains:

- Jindl, of broken chairs, a ludicrous gangly figure constantly humming to himself, around whom the ground is the only reliable seating surface.
- Blidibil, of mixed paint, who claims total colorblindness and additionally has an unusual effect on the digestion of nearby mortals.
- Goramor, of malfunctioning mechanical weapons, an unimaginably ancient gnome with intuitive comprehension of the most alien of devices.
- Ahamara, of cooked eggs, an enormous and blind matronly woman, said to hold simultaneously in her awareness each egg being cooked in that instant across the entire multiverse.
- Tist, of benevolent surprises gone awry, an attentive, placid feline in front of whom this visitor immediately made a fool of herself.**
- Slumn, of forgotten words, a tattooed and constantly shouting young man about whom no one can ever recall what he says.
- Koli, of greasepaint, an enormous jovial man who maintains constant makeup application as his skin grows increasingly aged and blotchy under the layers.
- Nolasa (no last name), of broken pottery, a plump bubbly woman with broken glasswork decorating her hair and clothes.
- The Bithsa (no first name), of faces that have changed before your very eyes, an old man cloaked in obsequious politeness who sadly makes peace with you over some circumstance he turns out not to have any influence over after all.
- Hoth’sar (no last name), of an accident that should not occur before it does yet somehow does anyway anyway anyway again and again at the same time, a tense ranting figure picked up by this visitor as this visitor feared herself grabbed by a pursuer.
- And many others.

Some visitors have entered the City of Doors with a uniquely doomed nature, until they found themselves in a venue wildly different from what they should have been searching for. A quasi-fourteenth century city complete with uniformed soldiers marching and parapets and banners and gleaming armor, yet every building constructed of molded black plastic and all door handles seemingly made of rubber to the touch. Every single inhabitant is wearing rings on every finger, literally all day long never removing them save to clean them or bathe, and each ring has its own paper tag indicating its inherent function in governing the wearer’s physical process: "Contemporary Royalty," "Passionate Crimes," "Swansong," etc. Each person’s metaphorical entropic influence is openly displayed as an unsettling character trait: dry skin flecked with desiccated insects; heels held together by duct tape; hair already starting to rot out; clothing evidently months out of fashion; faulty batteries needed to power one’s very thoughts.

One might expect, given the city’s condition, that it is surrounded by a blight of deserted buildings and empty streets. Yet no street is more than half full at any given time, due to the severe lack of amenities that could draw citizens elsewhere. On every block there is a grand three-story atrium with nothing inside but an abnormally voluminous and difficult-to-move recliner, a potbellied stove, and some candles on tables. In front stands an emaciated man with a huge knife whetting it on an enormous round stone: this place is both the butcher shop and the municipal armory. The greatest incentive for citizens staying in town at all times would be to ensure their countrymen do not maim each other by mistake as they sleep through the night.

The Church of Entropy (a highly informal term) worships the forces either behind natural decay or in sympathy with them, like any divine figure. Its most visible practice is to remain thoroughly unkempt. Hair, face, body: not a single element is to be neat and clean. The garb is exceedingly simple and appropriate for ritualistic acts of disorder: loose black robes of heavy fabric, sandals or wooden feet for moving freely through desert sands, blue eyeshadow and a stark black lipstick for freedom from the color gray. Members also seek out opportunities to intentionally play havoc on the forces attempting to assert higher order around them: night watchmen remove all their keys before setting out to their posts; monasteries and nunneries supply places for worship as cheaply as they can; self-running clocks are dismantled and the pieces sold to a collector of mechanical inscriptions; irate customers create confusion where there should be order by deciding not to pay at all for services rendered; underlings volunteer an extra cup into any order of set cutlery.

Each piece of the promenade is a linked set of floating islands that float invisibly through space until they are needed. The substance that they are made of is not an aesthetic choice, only a technical one; each section is made from something as close to weightless as possible to make them easy to move about and to position correctly; some sections are made of heavy material such as wood while others are made from lighter materials such as water or pyrite. Every island is identical in layout and dimensions, with each only differing slightly aesthetically (for example, some feature tilted floors and hanging swings),

THE PROMENADE OF CONGRUITIES

A slim peninsula forms a long arc off the coast of Axial, and on this strip of land sits the Promenade of Congruities: one long building that follows the land, growing over time, with every section built by different artists. Each new addition extends the original building with a space that simultaneously evokes two contrasting aesthetic properties, one of which is shared with the previous section. The contrasting sections are as follows:

- Cozy yet Spacious
- Spacious yet Cluttered
- Cluttered yet Minimal
- Minimal yet Oppressive
- Oppressive yet Peaceful
- Peaceful yet Cursed
- Cursed yet Hallowed
- Hallowed yet Sullied
- Sullied yet Luminous

- Vibrant yet Static
- Static yet Sporadic
- Sporadic yet Regular
- Regular yet Random
- Random yet Contrived
- Contrived yet Visible
- Visible yet Invisible
- Invisible yet Blessing
It is unknown whether the changes in each section were made by a single individual, or a group. Each section of the building is different, yet unique, telling a specific history while also telling the story of the whole structure.

THE GRAND MECHANISM

The Grand Mechanism is a machine built by an unknown artist. It was constructed around a large flat mesa that juts out from the desert sea, which was once part of the land's coast. The Mesa had been carved by glaciers during the cataclysm that created Axial's equatorial desert. The area used for construction is roughly circular with diameters of about 1200 m and remains largely intact despite numerous wars and hardships over thousands of years. The exterior walls are partly covered in intricate carvings many meters high and about 5 millimeters thick. They depict various scenes, mostly involving explosions of what appears to be some kind of gas. No one has attempted to remove a single image or piece since they seem intricately connected to each other even though no one knows how they work or function together as a whole. All attempts to analyze the carvings resulted in unfortunate and sometimes fatal accidents. These incidents only added to the mystery and myths surrounding the structure.

PYRAMID OF CIRRUS

The Pyramid of Cirrus, on the remains of an unknown island in the middle of an ocean which may have been once part of Axial's northern coast, is a massive pyramid about 900 m tall, 100 m wide at its base and 300 m wide at its apex with square-sided towers 100 m tall at each corner as well as in between each side. The surface of Pyramid is covered in small layers of ice that flakes off large chunks regularly. The interior touches temperatures sufficiently cold enough to leave frost even on exposed metal parts which were designed with some special materials capable of withstanding this deep cold temperature without exhibiting any visual effect. No one knows whether those designs were due to natural properties or artificial materials and equipment used during construction but are widely assumed to be artificial specially

The Wikipedia article for "Children Who Come Before Their Parents" is unusual and fascinating. Here is the text of the article:
###
Children Who Come Before Their Parents is a phenomenon that occurs in some cultures where the dead are buried before the living. It is also sometimes called "reverse burial" or "reversed burial". The phenomenon has been observed in Siberia, Polynesia, and Indonesia.
Children Who Come Before Their Parents is accounted for by the belief that children share an existence with their parents. This belief stems from a view of reincarnation or life after death in which children are reborn as adults immediately upon death.
This concept of reincarnation may be related to beliefs in a sort of afterlife where those who had died return to live again among their family and friends. The idea that children follow their parents after death could be considered based on this afterlife existence, as each child would have its own life to lead now free of the restrictions imposed by childhood. 
In some cultures, when a child dies they are buried beside or beneath an adult member of their family. In other cases some members of a family might be buried one right after another with no space between them

The Wikipedia article for "Children Who Come Before Their Parents" is unusual and fascinating. Here is the text of the article:

###

Children Who Come Before Their Parents is a phenomenon that was originally documented by Carlos Castaneda in his book The Active Side of Infinity. The phenomenon is that children who are conceived and born by a Yaqui sorcerer or brujo are aware that they have come from the future to fulfill an important duty. Typically, this awareness is shown when a child states before the parent has even met their significant other.

Other traits that seem to be common among these children are:

- They know how they died
- They have knowledge of events happening in places they've never been
- They speak with knowledge of "the language without words" (very difficult to translate)
- Their psychic abilities can be so high that even their parents can't measure them. Having a child like this isn't always fun and games because children like this tend to appear as if they're older than they really are, sometimes even into their 30's. Children who come before their parents often learn things at such an accelerated rate that it seems like it's impossible for them to learn anything. The reason for this is that as they age, their knowledge changes; they are actually growing and developing so quickly that they are essentially "outgrowing" their knowledge in the same way a toddler outgrows his clothes.

This phenomenon is especially interesting because it doesn't seem to be isolated to any specific culture or part of the world. People have reported cases of children who come before their parents from all over the world, but it does seem to be more common among certain cultures than others, such as the Yaqui Indians in Mexico, Native Americans in general (particularly Hopi), and Laplanders.

This phenomenon has been called many things, including "The Return," "Being Born Twice," and "Coming From A Far Country." Whatever you want to call it, it's certainly an interesting thing to think about!

**Plane Name: The Knot

Facets: Autonomy, Power, and Equilibrium

Description:

Almost nothing has been written about the Knot and this visitor, travelling there against all advice, gleaned little. It may be the most hazardous of any lamina, a churning landscape with no reliable purchase but only seas of cloud and mud split by geysers of steam and lava in which perplexing rocky outcrops rise and fall. Towering creatures, nightmarish and fascinating, crash dumbly through the landscape: endless serpents, amorphous horned behemoths, long-necked bony black equines, and segmented lumbering bulks with no discernible features. They appear to be chasing each other and themselves, often attempting, like an ouroboros, to devour their own bodies, tumbling to the ground.

Petitioners of this realm, known as Grips, are either very few or beyond sight during brief traveller forays. A handful were sighted astride—or being thrown from—behemoths, some of which had mounted upon them turret-like structures that may have been howdahs. Despite a conversation with a delirious Grip flung onto one of the few islands of stability, and a brief encounter with a laconic and meditative creature atop a passing behemoth, this visitor can only speculate on the the aspirations and function of this place.

The Grip's account of the purpose of the Knot was confused and contradictory. He claimed** that it was a place where the world's fabric was being knitted together, but also that it was a place where it was being unravelled. He said that he had been travelling for centuries, but also that he had only just arrived. He said that he had been sent to this place by his god, but also that he had come here to kill his god.

The Grip seemed to be in a state of extreme delirium, perhaps due to his long exposure to the elements or perhaps because of some toxic effect of the landscape itself. He spoke in an incoherent babble about his life and experiences, and about his hopes for the future. His words were mostly inaudible beneath the roaring of steam vents and the rumbling of passing behemoths, but they included such phrases as "the world is a tapestry", "I am a knot", "the Knot is my destiny", "I will die here", "my soul will be freed".

He then attempted to explain the nature of the Knot, but his words were lost in a volcanic eruption.

[The Knot]

**The most surprising feature of this lamina is that** ichor, the blood of the laminae, flows freely here. It is a thick, viscous fluid that is either black or red depending on the light and can be found in pools or rivers. The Grips drink it as if it were water.

The most surprising feature of this lamina is that it is a nexus of other laminae, and travellers have reported glimpsing other places from the summit of a behemoth.

***

**The most surprising feature of the The Bell is that** it is not a place of worship. The Kalons are not gods, and their sanctums are not temples. They do not ask for veneration or even respect, but only that visitors approach them with an open mind and heart.

The Bell is also home to many Kalons who do not create sanctums for visitors, but instead work on other projects. Some study the Universal Story itself, seeking to understand its structure and origins; others work on improving its presentation or distribution; still others seek to improve themselves through meditation and contemplation.

***

**The most surprising feature of the The Bell is that** it is not a paradise. The Kalons are not angels, and their work is not perfect. The Universal Story is a powerful gift, but it is not the only one, and its recipients are still human beings with all the flaws that entails. The Bell's most significant flaw is that it does not have a great deal of interest in those who do not wish to receive its gift. Those who enter with no intention of receiving the Universal Story will find themselves ignored by the Kalons, who will be unable to communicate with them even if they try. 

The Bell's final flaw is that it has been corrupted by its own success. As more and more people have received the Universal Story, fewer and fewer have come to The Bell for any other purpose than to receive it again. Many Kalons have become bitter about this trend, feeling that their art has been reduced to a tool for spreading propaganda rather than an expression of their deepest selves. Some have even become convinced that the Universal Story is a lie, and that the multiverse is not as it seems.

**In the cavernous workshops of The Asymmetry***, Grains work in solitude or in small groups, creating new forms of life and tools for the betterment of the community. They are highly secretive about their work, and only rarely do they reveal their creations to outsiders. When they do, it is usually because they have grown tired of the project and wish to pass it on to another Grain who will continue its development.

The Asymmetry is a large community with many different chambers and workshops, each one dedicated to a different purpose. The greatest chamber is called The Hall of Creation, where Grains come together to discuss new ideas and concepts for their projects. It is here that the majority of new creatures are created, though most are never seen by outsiders. In this chamber there are also libraries containing all manner of books and scrolls on every subject imaginable, including histories of the world before The Asymmetry was built.

Grains are very patient beings who take great pleasure in their work; they have no need for haste or urgency as they believe that everything will eventually be revealed in time. They have no concept of time as we know it; instead they measure the passage of time by the growth of their creations.

Grains are asexual beings who reproduce by dividing themselves into two or more parts, each of which becomes a new Grain. They have no gender and do not mate, but they do have relationships with one another that can last for centuries. These relationships are not sexual in nature, but rather intellectual and emotional; Grains can become very attached to one another and will often spend long periods of time together in deep conversation.

Grains are extremely intelligent beings who are capable of great feats of invention and creativity. They have an innate understanding of all things mechanical and biological, though they cannot create life from nothingness as we understand it; they must always work with existing forms. Grains are able to communicate with any creature or plant through telepathy, though they prefer to speak aloud when addressing other creatures. Their voices sound like a chorus of many different voices speaking at once, which is often disconcerting to outsiders.

Grains are very slow-moving creatures who rarely leave their workshops except for the occasional trip into the forest to gather

***

**Grains do not restrict themselves to creating just the creatures of Cardinal Worlds: they** also craft new tools and technologies, and even new philosophies. They are not above creating new deities, either, although they are wary of the consequences of such an act.

Grains are very patient beings, and do not rush their work. They have no concept of time as a linear progression, but rather as a cyclical process that is never-ending. Grains believe that when they die they will be reborn into the next cycle of creation, and so they do not fear death or old age. In fact, Grains look forward to death as a release from the labours of creation: it is only in death that they can rest and contemplate their creations without distraction.

Grains have no concept of ownership or possession: everything belongs to everyone equally. They also have no concept of violence or war: all conflict is resolved through negotiation and compromise. The Grains are therefore pacifists by nature, but this does not mean that they cannot defend themselves if necessary; it simply means that they will always try to resolve disputes peacefully first.

The Asymmetry is ruled by a council called The Symmetry, which is made up of the oldest and wisest Grains. The Symmetry decides on matters of great importance to the community, such as whether or not to create a new deity or what new technology should be introduced into Cardinal Worlds.

The Asymmetry is a very large community, and there are many different areas within it. The largest area is called The Grainworks, where Grains work on their creations. There are also places for worship and meditation, for recreation and entertainment, for education and training, for food production and storage, for waste disposal and recycling…

**Lamina name: The Instrument

Attributes: Hierarchy Utility Dissipation

Description:

The Instrument consists of the interior of a titanic clockwork automaton whose exterior has never been seen, and in its cramped and infinite chambers the residents of The Instrument, the Moilers, tend to its byzantine contraptions with maniacal focus. Any Moiler will tell you that something went very wrong in this place.  The Instrument’s purpose—if there ever was one—has long been lost to the culture here, and in the absence of that teleology the Moilers’ work takes on the frantic intensity of a unattainable goal and seems to have driven them mad. The Instrument presents its residents with a kaleidoscope of functions: raw materials cascading through chutes and filling up rooms, hallways locking and unlocking unpredictably and which contain caches of tools and undeciphered etchings and diagrams, all exposed by harsh white lighting and groaning and rumbling with echoes.

An industrious hierarchy has been consumed by the neurotic quest to map out their world and recover meaning in ever more baroque applications and measurements of the Instrument’s mechanisms. Cult-like groups carry out tasks driven by these interpretations: ferrying supplies back and forth uselessly, cleaning components and sanding materials into dust, analyzing schematics into meaninglessness, and chanting hypothetical decipherments into nonsense. Each Moiler manifests their burdens with their own elaborate tics and rituals, each facing an itch here that may never be scratched.

Moilers have competing hypotheses concerning the lost purpose of The Instrument:** some believe it was a clock, others that it was a weapon, and still others that it was a prison. The Instrument’s mechanisms are too complex to be understood by any one Moiler, and so the most popular theory is that the purpose of The Instrument is to understand itself.

The Instrument is not a maze, but rather an infinite machine whose internal workings are so complex that they can only be understood in terms of themselves. It is impossible to map out the entirety of The Instrument—there are no walls or floors or ceilings, just gears and pistons and levers stretching into infinity. However, the Moilers have developed their own language for describing its parts: “the Cogitator” refers to the main control center for all of The Instrument’s functions; “the Stacks” refers to a room full of stacks of books; “the Closet” refers to a room full of clothes; “the Pit” refers to an open space in which nothing happens; “the Machine” refers to everything else.

***

**Moilers have many competing hypotheses concerning the lost purpose of The Instrument:**

The Instrument was a weapon, and the Moilers are its victims.

The Instrument was a machine for transcending space and time, and the Moilers are its voyagers.

The Instrument was a prison, and the Moilers are its prisoners.

The Instrument was a temple, and the Moilers are its priests.

The Instrument was an engine of creation, and the Moilers are its creators.

***

**In the absence of an understanding of the purpose of The Instrument, Moilers busy themselves with ever more bizarre tasks of physical labor, such as** the construction of a giant clockwork machine that would fit inside the titanic automaton, or the attempt to build a perfect replica of The Instrument in miniature.

***

**In the absence of an understanding of the purpose of The Instrument, Moilers busy themselves with ever more bizarre tasks of physical labor, such as** carrying the same piece of material back and forth between two points, or endlessly cleaning a component. The Instrument is a clockwork machine whose purpose has been lost to time, and the Moilers are its unwitting slaves.

The Instrument is a place of endless labor, but it is also a place of endless discovery. The Moilers have found many strange things in their work: incomprehensible diagrams, inexplicable machines, and most importantly, other people. Some of these discoveries have been incorporated into the culture of The Instrument; others have been cast aside as meaningless.

The Instrument is an environment that is very difficult to navigate for those who are not Moilers. There are no maps or signs that point out where one might go next; there are only the mechanisms themselves and the strange markings on them that seem to be written in some kind of code. There are no landmarks or visual cues to orient oneself within this space; everything looks exactly the same wherever you go. In addition, The Instrument’s mechanisms are constantly moving and changing—doors open and close seemingly at random, chutes fill up with new materials from unknown sources, and the lights flicker on and off.

**In the absence of an understanding of the purpose of The Instrument, Moilers busy themselves with ever more bizarre tasks of bureaucracy and physical labor, such as** maintaining the bureaucracy of the bureaucracy.

Instrument name: The Clasping

Attributes: Hierarchy Empathy Dissipation

Description:

The Clasping is a city of interconnected structures, each one a series of concentric circles that radiate outwards from a central point. The outermost ring is the largest and most visible, and is comprised of hundreds of thousands of tiny buildings, each one no larger than a few feet across. These buildings are arranged in concentric rings around the center, with each successive ring being slightly smaller than the last. The next ring inward is comprised of tens of thousands of medium-sized buildings, which are arranged in concentric rings around the center. The next ring inward is comprised of hundreds of large buildings, which are arranged in concentric rings around the center. And so on until you reach the innermost circle, which contains only one building—a colossal structure that dwarfs all others by comparison. This building has no windows or doors and appears to be completely sealed off from the outside world. There are no discernible markings or symbols on any part of the building, and it is impossible to tell what material it is made of.

The Clasping’s residents are a people who have lost their ability to communicate with one another. They can still speak [sometimes found muttering to themselves], but they cannot understand each other. The residents of The Clasping live in constant fear of being unable to communicate with one another, and so they take great pains to avoid interacting with one another as much as possible. As a result, the city is completely silent except for the sound of wind blowing through its streets. The only time that the residents of The Clasping interact with one another is when they are in need of something from someone else—such as food or water—and so they must rely on an elaborate system of signs and gestures to communicate their needs.

The residents of The Clasping are also able to communicate with each other telepathically, but this ability has been repressed by generations of trauma and abuse at the hands of their leaders. As a result, most residents have no idea that this ability even exists within them, and those who do know about

**The most surprising feature of The Brink is** that it is a place of intense social cohesion and community. The Apeirons are not a race of solipsists, but rather are constantly engaged in an endless exploration of the self and others, and this is the source of their vitality. The Apeirons have no gods or leaders, but they do have a culture that provides for them a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves. This culture is expressed in the ceaseless performance of works that delight both the creator and audience, which in turn inspires further creation. The result is an endless cycle of creation and destruction that gives rise to ever-new forms.

The Brink is not without its dark side: some Apeirons become so obsessed with their own creations that they lose sight of everything else, including their own well-being; others become addicted to the pleasures available here; still others become lost in their search for new experiences and fail to find meaning in what they create; many fall into despair when confronted with the vastness of possibilities before them; some are driven mad by their inability to make sense of what they experience; and some are simply overwhelmed by the intensity of their experiences and become depressed.

***

**Apeirons perceive suffering in a totally unique way:** as a vital and even necessary component of the quest for fulfillment. They do not see suffering as an obstacle to be overcome, but rather as a necessary part of the process of becoming more than one is. The Brink is therefore not a place of escape from suffering, but rather a place where suffering is embraced and transformed into something else.

The Apeirons are led by the godlike Oinokai, who in their own words “are the closest thing to a deity that we have”. Oinokai are immortal beings who have achieved perfect balance between their emotional states and are thus able to guide others towards this state. They are not omnipotent or omniscient, but they can see far into the future and know what will happen if certain actions are taken. Oinokai are also very powerful in magic, though they rarely use it directly except when healing others or defending themselves against attackers.

The Apeirons believe that all beings should strive to become like Oinokai, and they have developed many techniques for achieving this goal. One such technique is the use of “psychotropic substances”, which are not addictive and do not cause any permanent damage to the body. These substances are used to induce temporary states of euphoria or depression, which can be used to achieve a balance between these two emotions.

The Apeirons also believe that the soul is immortal and that it will be reincarnated into another body after death. They believe that a person’s soul can be reincarnated into a different species if they have achieved perfect balance between their emotional states.
