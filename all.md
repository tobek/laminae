Maybe they have some rumored and controversial deal/symbiosis with CED?

crystalline structure

Some enormous oral history (perhaps song in unknown language) that everyone learns and memorizes but only elite understand what it means - laypeople are only as necessary initiated into bits of it where they learn this thing they've been doing/saying all their life actually means XYZ "The Retelling"

## Hierarchy Empathy Equilibrium LGP

<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZJBighPrnv9bSqTZ/31-laws-of-fun>

what is nature of LGP vs CGP, is it suffering vs none (pure peace), or suffering vs. "struggle" with no risk of failure.

- suffering vs struggle (effort) gives opportunity for hyper-optimized LGP struggle, but CGP might not hyper optimize cause C (although i guess could by evolutionary methods)
- what are other solutions to happiness without suffering?
- maybe CGP has like real pain and risk of failure, violence, gritty. but it's not as absolute a difference
- maybe it's about positive vs. negative consequence? although "you lost the competition" which i can imagine in LGP with struggle, is kind of a negative consequence.
- "I think the most you can plausibly say is that for humanlike architectures, memories of suffering (not necessarily true ones) are necessary to appreciate pleasures more complex than heroin."
	+ response: "Anyway it seems to me that utopianly speaking the proper psychological contrast for pleasure is sobriety rather than pain."
- competition and striving is entertained to a huge degree and satisfied by all the creative stuff. people revel in their various masteries. striving over status isn't really a thing - everyone has what they need.

*The ____*

	They constantly try to escape
	From the darkness outside and within
	By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.

	- T.S. Eliot, "The Rock"

Heaven. The ___ have taken it upon themselves to answer the question "is suffering needed to give context and shape to happiness?" and the answer is predetermined in their undying souls: "no". There is no suffering in ___---there are rules of course, but they are not stifling, and there is joy. The ___ of ___ are a resounding and convincing answer. This is a place where you could drop a demon into the middle of the realm, and the natural order and layout of things would guide him to be an enlightened angel. The academics of ___ study and pore endlessly over TODO to establish a perfect order that does not strive to insulate itself from the multiverse but that strives to create an endless bastion that can weather any change without doing anything except growing and perfecting.

Maybe a loose confederation of small cities, all within same min and max size, and if these ever fall or rise outside of these ranges they must split or consolidate. Cities A/B test themselves, with the most successful (mainly only by immigration and not births; births get re-assigned and raised collectively?) spreading, all aiming for the perfect civilization.

They are really really good at it. no issues with wireheading or "is struggle needed for happiness", the answer is obviously yes, but the struggle need not be suffering, there are hierarchies, there are successes and failures, value systems which petitioners strive to do well by and feel disappointment when they don't or others perceive that they don't, etc. but obviously this is a factor of great experimentation among cities. (or wait, is there some disagreement between LGP and CG...P about whether suffering oh wait at the otp right so either re-work this, or emphasis struggle vs. suffering).

all of this experimentation of millennia has produced amazing civilizations, but there doesn't seem to be an upper limit and they only continue to progress. some hyper-optimized cities have unbelievably intense struggle and competition, cyclic rituals of patience and joy

Tokyo?

Does this (and/or other planes) have anything to say about whether humans are fundamentally born good or evil, or blank slate?

the goal is that anyone can be dropped in and will become a wonderful citizen, and many petitioners will claim---gently, as if humbly admitting---that this is the case. in practice of course you can go fuck it up, yet there are also many instances of various incorrigibles finding perfect niches here

headsoak note 724 about a system designed to allow for bad actors vs. is it ok if the good guys do it when it's not ok if the bad guys do it. "if a system breaks down when its members are bad actors, then it's a shitty system." the counter to that is "if a building falls down when its built with rotten beams, then it's a shitty building", which is obviously false. but of course it's a spectrum of how many bad components a system can take before it breaks down, and of course, the more the better.

- artists, creative madness.?
- it's said that here more than any other outer outer plane, the membrane between reality and the Plane of Creation is thinned to a near breaking point.
- a gorgeous crazy world where *thought* is not possible, only observation and feeling
- observations are not quite reliable, they constantly flower with related or plausible images and variations - when you observe a boy, you also see a baby, a grown man, a woman, a tiger cub. when you perceive a castle, you also perceive a manor, a fortified wall, a dungeon, a floating island, an army. each observation leads to more observations, it's almost impossible to get one's bearing.
- a technique is to wear these pinhole goggles (not so pinhole that you get a full image like pinhole camera) so that you perceive as little as possible at once, so there's less branching. a similar technique has not been developed for hearing, since earmuffs equally dim all sound, but what is desired is a narrowing of sound. so total sound blockage is used, along with nose, since smell is a particularly evocative sense and the smells are myriad. touch TODO
- constant festival?
- what is it actually like? there's a recurring image of a boy in a chariot who seems to be a local deity, or perhaps there are many and they are the inhabitants.
- pure inspiration
- how do you get out?? many have been lost, maybe there's some aperture route you have to like train yourself to go

summary: A baffling and beautiful realm where ordinary thought is impossible: observations and feelings strike with such speed and force as to crowd out the conscious mind. It is like a manic dream and nothing is processed upon one's return.

*The Something*

TODO. This visitor was amused to find that her ramblings spouted upon return had been written down by her companion, which she presents to you here with some reluctance:

A boy on a chariot
A white horse
Wooden wind chimes
The smell of thyme
The color blue
Silent heavy snowfall
A starry night
Rustling leaves
Freshly baked bread
Full moon over an empty ocean
An elephant lumbering
An orchard
A bite of cucumber
A big old house
The sun rising
A ripe plum
A flock of swallows, their wings

You're standing barefoot on a field of deep, soft moss
Somewhere nearby a stream trickles
The air is thick with cool mist

One room has dancers in red and white.
A framed picture of a silver thread.
A book open to gilded curls of an illuminated manuscript
A door to an endless plain of black and white tiles
A single tulip in a mirrored hall

The indigo sisters
The touch of soft leather
An antelope stops and turns its head
A glass ocean
TODO yourself doing something
An iridescent hexagon
Three brothers on a row boat laughing
The owl perches on the gondola at high noon

A barren void. A pulsating fractured rainbow riverbed. A boy in a chariot. A waterfall up from the soil. A purple hedge bleeding out birds. A branching catacomb through translucent rock. A spire on a cliff. A pedestal topped by lizards. A drop of water. A lightning strike turns the lake to ice. A snake peeks its head out of a hole---or is it a whip, a belt, a rope? A sudden calm. A pit in the gut. A ring, a ringing. A gust of rosemary. An orchid leaps to life, a praying mantis. A flute lays eggs. A mountain coils and sings. A chariot rides its wave, a boy dismounts. A labyrinth, a maze, a mission, a foe, a dialog, an image, a geyser, a trickle. A boy in a chariot, a frown, a smile. A gate. A library of colors. The color of noise. A warm welcome.

- REF[Autonomy] tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.
- REF[Empathy] tends towards kindness, self-effacement, benevolence, righteousness, judgment, stubbornness, idealism, altruism, universalism, equity, compromise, compassion, and tolerance.
- REF[Dissolution] tends towards finality, rest, release, destruction, nullification, loss, ignorance, waste, death, and certainty.

vs NGD: no attempt to be fruitful about it or learn anything from it. autonomy thinks synthesis is pedantic and cowardly (synthesis thinks autonomy is reckless)

HOSPICE - more like doula, preparing for it

ritual bath that you die in?

- torture/masochism. sex? should be benevolent? or maybe there's some way for empathy to go wrong here. if you empathise with someone that loves pain... where does it go.
	- sex could also be CED, NED, NEC (dreams), NEP, CGP (brink), CGC (pure experience soup)
- connoiseurs of pain. maybe this is kinda gone wrong. really good at fucking you up and thinking they're doing you a favor.
	- should this go with sex?
	- maybe sex in two places, this one is masochism that also includes sex
	- yeah, masochism is about empathy. power is sexy but power that understands you is sexier
- missing senses? or other perception issue
- glitch: the only way to know something is by knowing how it breaks, and everything breaks in a way that's unique to the thing. sounds more like NGD or NND or NED or LED or LND.
- death?
- mirroring/doppelgangering?
- hive mind?
- is total absence of habit freedom? or is it its own kind of tyranny? funes el memorioso is relevant. CXX
- Apophatic theology ("attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God") vs. cataphatic theology (the opposite, using positive definitions) XXD

## Hierarchy Utility Equilibrium LNP

Archivists.

Everything is collected (in some unusual architectural shape, maybe captured in some preserving gel that floats and is connected to some crystalline structures).

They're "essentialists": trying to define the essences of any given object, but not into elements like fire or wind or even emotions or tendencies like excitement or neuroticism, but into very specific categories like "tending to ______" OR WAIT could be like counter words in japanese.

People come here to discover and define *themselves* like meyers briggs or astrology haha.

Is there some currency/market element to this?

the Mathematicians of Mechanus "hold that everything that you can imagine can be found on Mechanus in some form, and by cataloguing this and applying logic, symbolism and math to this one can unlock the secrets of the plane. They don't do this for riches or power: they are a group of serious minds who want to discover the secrets of the plane for scholastic reasons". be different from this

some connection to [Timaresh](http://www.rilmani.org/timaresh/Timaresh) where every written work in the multiverse is reflected, reproduced, and stored.

### storage

All or part of this plane is based around temporary and free, but regulated and often indefinite, storage.

people come from all over the multiverse to store stuff there, and they are REALLY GOOD at storage. they can store anything of any size, with any magical qualities or dangers or challenges. some fastidious dragons clear their treasure pits and store them for safekeeping, some store vanquished foes, cursed magical heirlooms, exotic pets, botched experiments, anything.

there are conditions to storage. maybe it has to be something they don't currently have? and if that's the case, they will store it for free, in flawless condition, taking care of it if necessary. part of the condition though maybe is that they have to be allowed to study it? can they touch it? they've never been known to mess anything up though. is there anything they won't store?

for people that said yes to everything in life

mutatorium

metamorphoses

Be-careful-what-you-wish-for self improvement

Poetic Terrorism

does it also have the outpost? maybe two places, has both

thin barrier to pure creation - which is thinner, here or CGC? should be here but feels like there. maybe this would be even crazier if it weren't for the mutatorium floating in the chaos, yeah! "utility"? outside are all possible factors, the raw stuff from which anything can be made

From the outside, the Mutatorium of TODO resembles a single nautilus shell the size of a small city. Its colors, ridges, and spirals constantly shift, but it holds impossibly still as the splurging winds of creation buffet its sheening impenetrable surface.

Inside, twisting fractal passageways that can be navigated only by the caretakers (a clan of well-meaning but quite thoroughly demented lillendi). People who seek great change in their life find their way here, either by mercenaries who ferry supplicants back and forth, or by certain spells or portals sought out by the enterprising. Some come to change their minds, some come to change their appearances, some come to change their future some come bring others (willing or unwilling) for changing. With sufficient planning, willpower, or skilled guides, the mutation sometimes goes according to plan. Unsurprisingly frequently, however, supplicants leave the Mutatorium with something very different than they intended.

No payment is expected for the services provided here - the plane itself supplies the raw materials necessary, and the caretakers partake for the joy of it.

What sustains the Mutatorium remains unknown, but the best guess is that the nautilus structure itself is responsible, and that it may be the husk of a dead Lawful Neutral god transported from the Astral Plane and revived into a powerful but dormant, semi-conscious state.

## Autonomy Utility Equilibrium CNP

for people that said no to everything life?

i guess just a perfect place to be alone, unless this moves to NED. if remains here: the perfect, beautiful place to be alone, everyone's crystalline gossamer bubble shell.

Voiders? The Wilt?

find stuff from dissimulation intro

An endless gray plain of enormous geometric holes in the ground, like that exhibit at DIA Beacon, also Chichu. Each void is inhabited by a single individual, residing in indefinite inertia and dissolution.

How do they end up there? Punishment, if NED. Apathy, giving up, failing. OR: people who just really really want to be alone.

They very very rarely talk to each other but will sometimes go on a pilgrimage to journey to another hole.

In one pit, two exhausted former partners fighting it out infinitely. Famously sought out for their wisdom, but sometimes you have to wait a long while until they exhaust themselves, and they never respond directly to your queries (this has been attempted).

Another pit is what people call "the anointed". It's huge, and appears to be infinitely deep, but a cylindrical pillar rises up from the depth to a height some distance below the rim of the hole. on it is a small plateau, with a patch of grass, on which a man sleeps. somehow sunlight shines on him

The arrangement of holes changing/unpredictable somehow? Holes slowly close up sometimes, inevitably trapping and crushing their resident, who invariably accept their fate with apathy.

Peaceful.

# **Hierarchy Power**

## Hierarchy Power Creation LEC

Labyrinthine catacombs where the some of the smartest minds in the multiverse plot intricate schemes. It's an immense civilization subdivided into self-organizing groups which tackle certain domains/styles TODO examples. Lower castes scheme smaller schemes, while barons and dukes plot the restructuring of entire cultures. What they actually *accomplish*, however, is a complete mystery. Residents are never seen to leave the plane or communicate with those outside it, and all plans witnessed by others seem to have no correlation to reality, e.g. plan to pollute the bloodline of a noble family over generations in order to watch a benevolent kingdom turn slowly upon its trusting populace, replete with incredibly specific details of allies and turncoats, locations to infiltrate, TODO, etc., but which refers to a place and bloodline that no outsiders can find.

Is the multiverse too big? Is the lamina somehow removed from the normal flow of time such that plans reference ancient things or predict and plan for things not yet come to pass? Are the plans expertly obfuscated such that spying outsiders never understand them? Neighboring powers tread carefully for fear of attracting the ire of this plane's denizens, so we can only assume that many of the longest cons and most devastating corruptions can be traced back to this plane. We can only assume.

Could be like Barbarella society, decadent

## Hierarchy Power Equilibrium LEP

tyrants

regimented armies. gauntlet and boot

paranoid tyrants holed up in indestructible fortresses, overwhelmingly prepared for threats that never materialize

easily the most militarily powerful of all the laminae, but since they remain in defensive mode indefinitely, it's all moot.

there was once some extraordinary incident where a trickster managed to harness their military might---maybe either by luring an enemy into hopeless attack against these guys, or by somehow managing them to, for once, sally out from their fortresses.

orwell quote, but what's the "danger and death", wouldn't they catch on eventually at possible threats never coming? or maybe orwellianish they hear about threats and attacks and incursions but none are real or they're all inside jobs, maybe even people know but they're terrified to say because they'll get disappeared if they disobey, it's an open secret. the struggle is really internal.

maybe it's actually not bad, if you're into it?
