what is nature of LGP vs CGP, is it suffering vs none (pure peace), or suffering vs. "struggle" with no risk of failure.

- suffering vs struggle (effort) gives opportunity for hyper-optimized LGP struggle, but CGP might not hyper optimize cause C (although i guess could by evolutionary methods)
- what are other solutions to happiness without suffering?
- maybe CGP has like real pain and risk of failure, violence, gritty. but it's not as absolute a difference
- maybe it's about positive vs. negative consequence? although "you lost the competition" which i can imagine in LGP with struggle, is kind of a negative consequence.
- "I think the most you can plausibly say is that for humanlike architectures, memories of suffering (not necessarily true ones) are necessary to appreciate pleasures more complex than heroin."
	+ response: "Anyway it seems to me that utopianly speaking the proper psychological contrast for pleasure is sobriety rather than pain."
- competition and striving is entertained to a huge degree and satisfied by all the creative stuff. people revel in their various masteries. striving over status isn't really a thing - everyone has what they need.

*The ____*

	They constantly try to escape
	From the darkness outside and within
	By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.

	- T.S. Eliot, "The Rock"

Heaven. The ___ have taken it upon themselves to answer the question "is suffering needed to give context and shape to happiness?" and the answer is predetermined in their undying souls: "no". There is no suffering in ___---there are rules of course, but they are not stifling, and there is joy. The ___ of ___ are a resounding and convincing answer. This is a place where you could drop a demon into the middle of the realm, and the natural order and layout of things would guide him to be an enlightened angel. The academics of ___ study and pore endlessly over TODO to establish a perfect order that does not strive to insulate itself from the multiverse but that strives to create an endless bastion that can weather any change without doing anything except growing and perfecting.

Maybe a loose confederation of small cities, all within same min and max size, and if these ever fall or rise outside of these ranges they must split or consolidate. Cities A/B test themselves, with the most successful (mainly only by immigration and not births; births get re-assigned and raised collectively?) spreading, all aiming for the perfect civilization.

They are really really good at it. no issues with wireheading or "is struggle needed for happiness", the answer is obviously yes, but the struggle need not be suffering, there are hierarchies, there are successes and failures, value systems which petitioners strive to do well by and feel disappointment when they don't or others perceive that they don't, etc. but obviously this is a factor of great experimentation among cities. (or wait, is there some disagreement between LGP and CG...P about whether suffering oh wait at the otp right so either re-work this, or emphasis struggle vs. suffering).

all of this experimentation of millennia has produced amazing civilizations, but there doesn't seem to be an upper limit and they only continue to progress. some hyper-optimized cities have unbelievably intense struggle and competition, cyclic rituals of patience and joy

Tokyo?

Does this (and/or other planes) have anything to say about whether humans are fundamentally born good or evil, or blank slate?

the goal is that anyone can be dropped in and will become a wonderful citizen, and many petitioners will claim---gently, as if humbly admitting---that this is the case. in practice of course you can go fuck it up, yet there are also many instances of various incorrigibles finding perfect niches here

headsoak note 724 about a system designed to allow for bad actors vs. is it ok if the good guys do it when it's not ok if the bad guys do it. "if a system breaks down when its members are bad actors, then it's a shitty system." the counter to that is "if a building falls down when its built with rotten beams, then it's a shitty building", which is obviously false. but of course it's a spectrum of how many bad components a system can take before it breaks down, and of course, the more the better.

Archivists.

Everything is collected (in some unusual architectural shape, maybe captured in some preserving gel that floats and is connected to some crystalline structures).

could be collected via verges, but some way of ensuring the object's safety - objects verged into the collection tend to be miraculously resilient - the church that is the only building left standing after a volcanic eruption wipes out a town, the delicate string instrument that has against all odds survived centuries, the artifact of glass or ceramic in perfect condition, etc. other times, when this can no longer be sustained, the verge is severed such that the object remains here, such as a treasure lost at sea that is inexplicably missing when the ruins are later dredged and searched

They're "essentialists": trying to define the essences of any given object, but not into elements like fire or wind or even emotions or tendencies like excitement or neuroticism, but into very specific categories like "tending to ______" OR WAIT could be like counter words in japanese.

People come here to discover and define *themselves* like meyers briggs or astrology haha.

Is there some currency/market element to this?

the Mathematicians of Mechanus "hold that everything that you can imagine can be found on Mechanus in some form, and by cataloguing this and applying logic, symbolism and math to this one can unlock the secrets of the plane. They don't do this for riches or power: they are a group of serious minds who want to discover the secrets of the plane for scholastic reasons". be different from this

some connection to [Timaresh](http://www.rilmani.org/timaresh/Timaresh) where every written work in the multiverse is reflected, reproduced, and stored.

include storing like styles/motifs, e.g. "Hamonshu - A Japanese Book of Wave and Ripple Designs" and the tibetan book

### storage

All or part of this plane is based around temporary and free, but regulated and often indefinite, storage.

people come from all over the multiverse to store stuff there, and they are REALLY GOOD at storage. they can store anything of any size, with any magical qualities or dangers or challenges. some fastidious dragons clear their treasure pits and store them for safekeeping, some store vanquished foes, cursed magical heirlooms, exotic pets, botched experiments, anything.

there are conditions to storage. maybe it has to be something they don't currently have? and if that's the case, they will store it for free, in flawless condition, taking care of it if necessary. part of the condition though maybe is that they have to be allowed to study it? can they touch it? they've never been known to mess anything up though. is there anything they won't store?

## Autonomy Empathy Dissolution CGD

- REF[Autonomy] tends towards freedom, independence, unpredictability, individualism, ad hoc invention, radicalism, dynamism, chaos, and change.
- REF[Empathy] tends towards kindness, self-effacement, benevolence, righteousness, judgment, stubbornness, idealism, altruism, universalism, equity, compromise, compassion, and tolerance.
- REF[Dissolution] tends towards finality, rest, release, destruction, nullification, loss, ignorance, waste, death, and certainty.

vs NGD: no attempt to be fruitful about it or learn anything from it, homage to it, anything. specifically death, also pain? autonomy thinks synthesis is pedantic and cowardly (synthesis thinks autonomy is reckless)

HOSPICE - more like end-of-life doula, preparing for it

ritual bath that you die in?

- torture/masochism. sex? should be benevolent? or maybe there's some way for empathy to go wrong here. if you empathise with someone that loves pain... where does it go.
	- sex could also be CED, NED, NEC (dreams), NEP, CGP (brink), CGC (pure experience soup)
	- CGD and LEC are exact opposite, two visions of sex
	- memoirs of hadrian quote about erotic knowledge
- connoiseurs of pain. maybe this is kinda gone wrong. really good at fucking you up and thinking they're doing you a favor.
	- should this go with sex?
	- maybe sex in two places, this one is masochism that also includes sex
	- yeah, masochism is about empathy. power is sexy but power that understands you is sexier
- missing senses? or other perception issue
- glitch: the only way to know something is by knowing how it breaks, and everything breaks in a way that's unique to the thing. sounds more like NND or NED or LED or LND.
- death?
	- deathbed phenomena
	- deathbed confessions - to alleviate guilt/regrets/secrets/sins
	- deathbed conversions
	- deathbed declarations - Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri — "no-one on the point of death should be presumed to be lying"
- mirroring/doppelgangering?
- hive mind?
- is total absence of habit freedom? or is it its own kind of tyranny? funes el memorioso is relevant. CXX
- Apophatic theology ("attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God") vs. cataphatic theology (the opposite, using positive definitions) XXD
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Lavandi%C3%A8res
- skilled in making poignant bargains? very rare granting of wishings, which sometimes include being returned to life, or having another killed in their place?
- <gpt>The Cumulative is a place of rest where sentient creatures are stored until their memories have been exhausted. Then the beings are put into deep sleep for further cumulative dreaming until they are eventually released to the fertile fields of the Midsummer to begin life anew.</gpt>
- a (mist-shrouded) forest?
- allowed glimpses into possible pasts or futures that they might not otherwise have.
- some area where whole civilizations are laid to rest, edge of the forest: <gpt>An infinite expanse of pure white, broken by a few distant and tiny islands of solidified and partially-crystallized time. The Spacefarers tend to the dying remains of dead civilizations, frozen in history on those islands.</gpt>

maybe this is the forgetting place. he wants it all to himself, like "_____ appears to be a complicated place, but thanks to the efforts of the jealous Forgetful Duke, it all seems rather simple once you've left."

The Procedure? interesting association, sounds a bit LXX, maybe a synonym

Murder as art

Maybe they have some rumored and controversial deal/symbiosis with LGC? Like they're good at flawlessly disappearing the handful of people who don't fit in... oh wait LGP. And that sounds like LED should do that.

magical research outpost could be here
