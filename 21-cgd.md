summary: "The Bough is a hazily luminous land of waterways and forests in which Quells gently watch over the affairs of flesh: comforting the dying, exploring the congress of pain and pleasure, and plucking out the scars and memories of mortals who no longer need them."

intro: |

    Where REF[NEC], the REF[lamina](laminae) of dreams, is usually a mortal's first experience of the laminae, the Bough is invariably the last, for all deaths pass under the influence of this place. When death TODO(better)[draws near], REF[verges] develop between this realm and REF[cardinal] worlds, through which are sighted the dim placid waterways and luminous nostalgic fog of this place as visions of near-death phenomena, and figures in such visions are the Quells that reside here as REF[petitioners], pale and delicately beautiful, watching over the soon-to-be-departed and offering succor to their loved ones.

    The fading of mortal fleshed is intimately linked to its pains and pleasures, which in the hazy upland forests of the Bough are experienced as a project of intuitive education, vastly different from the unquenchable experimentation and dominance that define that other lamina known for its erotic pursuits, REF[LEC], whose facets lie precisely opposite the Bough. In the receiving of pain one is unified with the suffering that is shared by all conscious beings, and in the providing of pain one becomes for that moment a force of nature, and through this exchange beings can TODO(terrible)[] truly see one another. Lovemaking carries its participants to a world that is otherwise out of reach---in those brief moments, the Bough is glimpsed.

    Some Quells practice this project in the form of symbiotic grooming, reaching out through verges to pluck scars and memories no longer needed by mortals; such pickings are to Quells bright gems of TODO(be more precise)[empathic alleviation]. Some visitors come to the Bough for unmediated congress with this process, curling up in the velvet petals of a great flower with one Quell who gently pores over them, softly extricating the weary detritus of mortal experiences. Though it is a profoundly healing process, those that spend too long in this TODO(dupe)[gentle] coition find themselves relieved of more than they intended, and some find themselves relieved of everything.

<!--
what's the point?

-
-->

- inuititive
- seen as a kind of intimate education, unification with todo. in the enacting of pain one is murderer and destroyer, and in the receiving of it one is unified with the suffering of all conscious beings.
- yet this process is TODO a slave to love, for understanding and accepting blah is to love
- alleviation

TODO have searched trinym and gone through names and demonyms, but should go through all other elements

- name
    - The Bough
    - The Fruition (mentioned in CGP culture)
    - The Lacuna (unfilled space or interval, gap)
    - The Lattice
    - The Nourish
    - The Pith
    - The Quell
    - The Sequitur ("it follows" - conclusion, deduction)
    - The Yield
- demonym
    - Drifts
    - Marrows
    - Mercies (possible NND missing petitioners)
    - Quells <--
    - Tides
- quotes
    - 128. ...It won’t take forever, nothing takes forever, but so many things take longer than we have. (NNP? CGD? LGC?)
    - 170. Closing a door very gently, you pull with one hand, push with the other. (CGD, NED)
- environment
- culture
- cardinal interaction

info gathering

- questions
- future research
- possible environment
    - a (mist-shrouded) forest with waterways?
    - japanese garden?
    - islands
- likely elements
    - ritual bath that you die in
    - hospice - more like end-of-life doula, preparing for it: they watch over every death
    - masochism: connoiseurs of pain, loving empathy sex
    - symbiotic grooming creatures
    - the dying pass through here on their way to other laminae... typical
    - nostalgia - CGD or NGD?
- possible elements
    - torture/masochism. sex? should be benevolent? or maybe there's some way for empathy to go wrong here. if you empathise with someone that loves pain... where does it go.
        - sex could also be CED, NED, NEC (dreams), NEP, CGP (brink), CGC (pure experience soup)
        - CGD and LEC are exact opposite, two visions of sex
        - memoirs of hadrian quote about erotic knowledge
        - https://knowingless.com/2019/08/17/you-will-forget/ NGD or CGD?
            - I became sadistic. I’d previously been embracing a sort of masochism – education in the pain, fearlessness of eternal torture or whatever – but as my identity expanded to include *that which was educating me*, I found myself experiencing sadism. I enjoyed causing pain to myself, and with this I discovered evil. I found within me every murderer, torturer, destroyer, and I was shameless. As I prostrated myself on the floor, each nerve ending of my mind writhing with the pain of mankind, I also delighted in subjecting myself to it, in being it, in causing it. I became unified with it.
            - The evil was also subsumed by, or part of, love. Or maybe not “love” – I’d lost the concept of love, where the word no longer attached to a particular cluster of sense in my mind. The thing in its place was something like *looking*, where to understand something fully meant accepting it fully. I loved everything because I Looked at everything. The darkness felt good because I Looked at it. I was complete in my pain only when I experienced the responsibility for inducing that pain.
    - symbiotic creatures groom and pick things off you, but not physical stuff, something else, emotional/dreams too easy, but they live off of it? there's some efficiency here. don't stay too long or it's too much? CGD and it's sexual? very intimate. inside a flower
    - connoiseurs of pain. maybe this is kinda gone wrong. really good at fucking you up and thinking they're doing you a favor.
        - should this go with sex?
        - maybe sex in two places, this one is masochism that also includes sex
        - yeah, masochism is about empathy. power is sexy but power that understands you is sexier
    - missing senses? or other perception issue
    - death
        - deathbed phenomena
        - deathbed confessions - to alleviate guilt/regrets/secrets/sins
        - deathbed conversions
        - deathbed declarations - Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri — "no-one on the point of death should be presumed to be lying"
    - someone or a group famous for making works of art that convince the viewer to commit suicide. (you must be interviewed first and it's tailored?) (CGP if nowhere else - CGD LED CNP)
    - mirroring/doppelgangering?
    - is total absence of habit freedom? or is it its own kind of tyranny? funes el memorioso is relevant. CXX
    - Apophatic theology ("attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God") vs. cataphatic theology (the opposite, using positive definitions) XXD
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Lavandi%C3%A8res - celtic myth, "The three old women go to the water's edge at midnight to wash shrouds for those about to die"
    - skilled in making poignant bargains? very rare granting of wishings, which sometimes include being returned to life, or having another killed in their place?
    - <gpt>The Cumulative is a place of rest where sentient creatures are stored until their memories have been exhausted. Then the beings are put into deep sleep for further cumulative dreaming until they are eventually released to the fertile fields of the Midsummer to begin life anew.</gpt>
    - some place where you can peer through the looking glass of "what if" moments in your own life. CNC? CGC? CNP? NEP? eh. see oracle. interesting in CED maybe. CGD?
    - some area where whole civilizations are laid to rest, edge of the forest: <gpt>An infinite expanse of pure white, broken by a few distant and tiny islands of solidified and partially-crystallized time. The Spacefarers tend to the dying remains of dead civilizations, frozen in history on those islands.</gpt> - a little CND-ish though
    - "liminal deity" (presiding over transitions, thresholds, crossers of boundaries) CNC? CGD?
    - psychopomps (creatures, spirits, angels, or deities in many religions whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls from Earth to the afterlife) CGD
