    [Translator's note: Sadly no completed chapter for this lamina was found amongst the author's papers, only a short page of notes written after an apparent mishap, which we present here in its stead, in as equivalent form to the original notes as possible. Due to extensive shorthand and hurried penmanship these notes have been particularly difficult to decipher.]

    ### Taxonomy, draft and old notes lost in departure from [illegible], jotting down reminders from memory for now

    crystal lattice &middot; cataloguing nested/overlapping ontologies, universally each [illegible]

    balanced on verges vs present on lamina, verge > severed and remaining here, "lost" on cardinal

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost objects in Hive

    SKEINS &middot; delightful petitioners, bizarre questions, intently learning not sure what? asked Rowen about his [unknown glyph] and color perception, me about Bloom/Islet tea, Soblei bead map, Tristo's riddle, doppelganger experiment, took copy of notes &c

    "essentialists" &middot; material cause, formal cause, efficient cause, final cause &middot; answering "why?" for each

    unlocking/understanding & grouping by surface [illegible] filament: [unknown glyphs]

    visual distortion effect &middot; imagine folding paper &middot; this is the topology [illegible] & so maps differently here

    STORAGE &middot; only what they lack, perfect handling, they will study it

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things they won't store

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defense against treasure hunters &middot; obscurity & size

    perfectly unambiguous language &middot; all statements inflected w emotional attitude, confidence, source, level of agreement, &c

    transportation network &middot; all laminae?

TODO(maybe use scribal shorthand here!! but would translator translate it?)



Collecting everything in a crystalline library hive, for cataloging and categorization according to infinitely varied sets of overlapping ontologies, none of which can be argued to be a universally useful or applicable paradigm. Also, free storage of stuff they don't have? Lost and found?

Everything is collected (in some unusual architectural shape, maybe captured in some preserving gel that floats and is connected to some crystalline structures).

could be collected via verges, but some way of ensuring the object's safety - objects verged into the collection tend to be miraculously resilient - the church that is the only building left standing after a volcanic eruption wipes out a town, the delicate string instrument that has against all odds survived centuries, the artifact of glass or ceramic in perfect condition, etc. other times, when this can no longer be sustained, the verge is severed such that the object remains here, such as a treasure lost at sea that is inexplicably missing when the ruins are later dredged and searched

They're "essentialists": trying to define the essences of any given object, but not into elements like fire or wind or even emotions or tendencies like excitement or neuroticism, but into very specific categories like "tending to ______" OR WAIT could be like counter words in japanese.

People come here to discover and define *themselves* like meyers briggs or astrology haha.

Is there some currency/market element to this?

the Mathematicians of Mechanus "hold that everything that you can imagine can be found on Mechanus in some form, and by cataloguing this and applying logic, symbolism and math to this one can unlock the secrets of the plane. They don't do this for riches or power: they are a group of serious minds who want to discover the secrets of the plane for scholastic reasons". be different from this

some connection to [Timaresh](http://www.rilmani.org/timaresh/Timaresh) where every written work in the multiverse is reflected, reproduced, and stored.

include storing like styles/motifs, e.g. "Hamonshu - A Japanese Book of Wave and Ripple Designs" and the tibetan book

### storage

All or part of this plane is based around temporary and free, but regulated and often indefinite, storage.

people come from all over the multiverse to store stuff there, and they are REALLY GOOD at storage. they can store anything of any size, with any magical qualities or dangers or challenges. some fastidious dragons clear their treasure pits and store them for safekeeping, some store vanquished foes, cursed magical heirlooms, exotic pets, botched experiments, anything.

there are conditions to storage. maybe it has to be something they don't currently have? and if that's the case, they will store it for free, in flawless condition, taking care of it if necessary. part of the condition though maybe is that they have to be allowed to study it? can they touch it? they've never been known to mess anything up though. is there anything they won't store?

    - "All things will be in danger of being taken in a sense different from their own proper sense, and, whilst taken in that different sense, of losing their proper one, if they are called by a name which differs from their natural designation. Fidelity in names secures the safe appreciation of properties." Tertullian, De Carne Christi 13:2 (LNP?)

- questions
- future research
- possible elements
    - breaking down all of these https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html maybe LNP or NNC
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes - material, formal, moving, purpose - NNC and/or LND or LNP
    - formlessness vs EXTREMELY existent
    - Lost and found (maybe in CEC or CNC or LNP or CNP or CED) (maybe connected through some weird backdoor to the storage plane?) (i guess CND too, maybe a rumor of a lost objects troupe you can sometimes find stuff in)
    - non-euclidean/visual distortion like Rorik Smith polyhedral pics or something (NNC? LNP) LGC uses but not really geometric, more just weird
    - strange loops - used in LGP as stone-cutter, but could re-appear elsewhere
        + Synthesis facet? relies on the existence of structured/hierarchical stuff but also violates it. LXX or NXX. LNP LED LGC LEP LGP
    - language where you can easily indicate things like how confident you are in something or whether you support it - LNP?
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban "Lojban has a fully developed set of metalinguistic and emotional attitude indicators that supplant much of the baggage of aspect and mood found in natural languages, but most clearly separate indicative statements from the emotional communication associated with those statements. This might lead to freer expression and consideration of ideas, since stating an idea can be distinguished from supporting that idea. The set of possible indicators is also large enough to provide specificity and clarity of emotions that is difficult in natural languages."
    - some kind of transportation system? mechanical or biological. LNP?
