summary: Unique among all laminae, no petitioners have been found on the blizzarding tundra of the Pasture, only a small nomadic caravan of mortals pursuing a mental state of "unknowing" that they believe will allow their souls to become petitioners here, thereby restoring the lamina's role in the balance of the multiverse, and in persisting through this arctic wasteland they hope to one day find evidence of their success.

intro: |

    Unique among all laminae, no REF[petitioners] or REF[laminals] are known to populate the Pasture. It exists in a state of permanent whiteout, a deafening snowstorm over a wasteland interrupted by sheared-off crevasses and cliffs. The only life here is a nomadic community that refers to themselves as the Unfettered: about one hundred mortals who, according to their oral history, have been travelling here for over thirty generations, searching for petitioners and hoping to become them.

    Believing that each lamina and its petitioners perform a critical role, and that their apparent absence here throws the multiverse out of balance, the Unfettered are inexorable in their quest. They seek a state of "unknowing"---to empty their minds of the complexity of existence and enter a cloud of forgetting. Their tradition states that this path will align them with the nature of the Pasture such that, upon death, their souls will repopulate this place as petitioners, and that as petitioners they could spread the purity of unknowing, a vital counterbalance for the exhausting and unsustainable mission of creation that preoccupies the minds of their mortal brethren.^[Indeed, scholars have long supposed that there is a fundamental imbalance in favor of REF[Creation], for if this force were equally balanced with REF[Dissolution] then how would we come to find that there is anything present in the multiverse at all? It is much easier to destroy than it is to create and yet everywhere around us we see the building of civilizations. Perhaps it is the lack of petitioners on this lamina that has permitted our existence at all. Should the Unfettered succeed in their goal and this endless growth cease, may we hope it replaced not by the collapse of things but instead by a true REF[Equilibrium].] And so apart from the toil of their meagre survival they spend their days marching through the snow, to the sound of fire and drums, throat singing and ethereal hymns, the entire troupe with their eyes closed^[The closed eye is a symbol that the Unfettered hold dear, and they carve it into simple ivories with which they adorn themselves. This visitor lost track of the time---weeks perhaps---that she spent with these pilgrims, walking in darkness and listening to their chants and the howling blizzard that they call the Curtain and embrace as their own, and as a reminder of their dedication and clarity of purpose she still wears their gift of a closed eye pendant.] save for a lookout to navigate the landscape.

    The Unfettered sustain themselves on the flesh of mammoth beasts they search for buried in the permafrost, each one of which provides months' worth of food. At the core of their caravan is an unusual double-REF[aperture](apertures) embedded in a dolmen that they drag across the snow on sledges. On one side of the structure is an aperture to REF[Soblei], by which rare visitors arrive and from which a steady gale of wind clears snow from their path and creates an eye-of-the-storm in which their convoy is partially shielded from the blizzard. On another side of the structure is an aperture to an unknown realm from which spills the flames of a perpetual inferno, warming the community and allowing for the cooking of meat and melting of ice for water, and creating a plume of black smoke that ascends into a whirlwind above---a landmark by which to return to the caravan after searches for food or petitioners.^[The Unfettered tell that in early days they kept warm only by furs and oil lamps of blubber, but that many generations of constant flame and ritual intention opened up this aperture to a world of fire.] Scholars report other apertures that have been determined to lead to the Pasture but that open upon only blizzard; nothing has been found.

what's the point?

- spooky and tragic and mysterious and beautiful
- incredible commitment

so perfectly embodying dissolution that there seems to be nothing here at all

some give up and hazard into soblei to find a new world. others have been known to give up and wander off into the blizzard

    - they love the environment. many who have left have returned
    - unknowing
    - "For He can well be loved, but he cannot be thought. By love he can be grasped and held, but by thought, neither grasped nor held. And therefore, though it may be good at times to think specifically of the kindness and excellence of God, and though this may be a light and a part of contemplation, all the same, in the work of contemplation itself, it must be cast down and covered with a cloud of forgetting. And you must step above it stoutly but deftly, with a devout and delightful stirring of love, and struggle to pierce that darkness above you; and beat on that thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love, and do not give up, whatever happens."
    - "If you want to gather all your desire into one simple word that the mind can easily retain, choose a short word rather than a long one. A one-syllable word such as "God" or "love" is best. But choose one that is meaningful to you. Then fix it in your mind so that it will remain there come what may. This word will be your defence in conflict and in peace. Use it to beat upon the cloud of darkness above you and to subdue all distractions, consigning them to the cloud of forgetting beneath you."
